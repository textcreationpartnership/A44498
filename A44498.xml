            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And yet it alſo admoniſheth thee to beware of the leaven Pharaſees which is hypocriſie: of being too raſh and cenſorious in judging
<pb facs="tcp:109968:3"/>thoſe that having been prophane and evil livers, or abuſers of God's grace and truth, return therefrom to a better mind; or of judging God's, and Chriſt's, or his Servants dealings with ſuch, when by the profeſsion of ſuch perſons, he, or evidently and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently they, are more gracious and ready to receive ſinners than thou wouldſt have them. There is nothing more eminently diſcovered in God, than love and charity to the ſouls of men; whereof the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and all the holy men in the Scriptures bear their teſtimony, eſpecially in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving repentant ſinners. And therefore nothing ſhould be more deſired by us, and rejoyced in on their behalf, than their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to him, and finding his gracious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance. God's children ſhould be (and are in ſome meaſure) like to God himſelf, who is their Father, and therefore as his elect, holy, and beloved, put on bowels of mercy, kindneſs, lowlineſs of mind, long-ſuffering —and above all charity, which is the bond of all perfection, as the Apoſtle exhorteth, <hi>Col. 3.12.14.</hi> Nor doth any thing (ſcarce) make men liker the Devil than to endeavour to hinder or to repine at the converſion of ſinners or God's mercy to them, as that was one concomitant (or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb facs="tcp:109968:4"/>rather) of the Pharaſees zeal and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, their oppoſing Chriſt, and grudging at him, for his charity to ſinners; ſo, I ſuppoſe, it was none of the leaſt of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of that evil frame which occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſtiling them the children of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, <hi>Joh. 8.44.</hi> Well may we be glad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, when we find any ſuch thing as a ſincere convert in theſe evil days, and God gracious to ſinners therein: When there are ſo many Apoſtates from God, ſo few Converts to him.</p>
            <p>Converts there may be ſome to this or that opinion or practiſe, from ſome open prophanneſs, ſometimes to thriftineſs, and worldlineſs (and yet even ſuch converſions are not ſo frequent in theſe days, as from thriftineſs to prodagality and rudeneſs) ſometimes poſsibly to ſome opinionative pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, or zealous endeavour after righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that is, not Gods, but mens own; but few that when they return, return to the Lord, <hi>Jer. 4.1.</hi> to mind, and receive, and walk in the knowledg and faith of him, and his great goodneſs to mankind in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord, and ſo to behold his glory, as thereby to be changed into his image by the operation of his power and ſpirit, and ſo to worſhip God in the ſpirit, as

Phil. 3.3. <hi>Rejoyce in Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; have no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the fleſh.</hi> When we ſee any turning to this we have cauſe to be glad and rejoyce for them, for they turn from death to life, from miſery to ſalvation, and unſpeakable felicity. But alas! more play the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals in going from Chriſt and God, and the living in the faith and knowledge of him as the fountain of life and righteouſneſs, to live upon either their outward or inward receits from him, their riches, friends, wit, parts, or their righteous frames and endeavours, receits, and attainments, (which lived upon will ſoon, with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digals patrimony, be ſpent, and leave them to loſſe and beggary, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ſervile drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and deſire of husks) then do imitate him in returning to God and Chriſt, to live in his houſe, and upon him, and his proviſion therein, the grace (not in us, but) in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>2 Tim. 2.1.</hi> which is, and may be, matter of great lamentation. Yet, if thou beeſt a ſinner, walking in thy ſelf, thine own will, wiſdom, righteouſneſs, luſts, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections or appetites, and ſo not in Chriſt Jeſus, not in the way of underſtanding, not in the ſpirit, but in the fleſh, and ſo in a ſtate of ſin, (as ſuch there be great ſtore,
<pb facs="tcp:109968:5"/>both of perſons in a ſort zealous and of prophane) here is that that may move thee to repent and to turn to God therefrom. Both the evil and dangerouſneſs of the ſtate of ſin and ſinners, and the acceptableneſs to God of true and unfeined repentance in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to Chriſt, and ſo to God in and by him is here toucht upon; and its largely evidenced, that God is ready to embrace ſuch as ſo do return, and to give them the moſt ſure ſigns and pledges of his mercy toward them, as having joy in their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And indeed this is the main ſcope of the Parable herein paraphraſtically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, and of the Text opened and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, and by conſequence (of a great part at least) of the enſuing diſcourſe, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to thee the great goodneſs of God (as to thoſe that walk with him in his ways, to which he invites thee in calling thee to repentance, ſo alſo) to thoſe that turn at his reproofs into his ways; in his readineſs to forgive ſins paſt through his forbearance, and to teſtifie his gladneſs for their eſcape from the dangers of deſtruction they were in while ſinning; in his giving them the comforts of his grace in Chriſt, and taking them under his moſt ſafe and ſatisfying protection and bleſsing. Surely, as its bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:109968:5"/>to be feaſting and making merry at home with a rich, liberal, and loving Father, than to be abroad among ſtrangers (nay enemies) in a ſtrange Country, keeping ſwine in the cold fields, and ready there to periſh with hunger: So (and far more) better is it to be in God's fear, and in the faith of Jeſus, walking in the ways of righteouſneſs, and enjoying the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt, in the aſſured perſwaſions of God's favour towards us, and of eternal life and happineſs, than to be the drudges and ſworn vaſſels of ſin and Satan, grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the ſtings of an accuſing Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and fears of God's moſt dreadful and everlaſting wrath and vengeance, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in the ways of ſin thereto by evil ſpirits, who rejoyce ſo much in nothing as in bringing men unto everlaſting deſtruction. The aſſured hope of attaining which good things, and eſcaping which evil things, is in this Parable and diſcourſe ſet clearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, as to the good ground thereof, to be proved in an hearty turning to God in Chriſt by thee: And verily, the certainty of ſpeeding well in any courſe is a marvail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous great ſpur to the undertaking it; hope of profit and pleaſure upon uncertain grounds uſually draw men to great adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb facs="tcp:109968:6"/>here, much more do certain. Behold here certain grounds of hoping for and expecting the greateſt profits and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that are poſsible, propoſed to thee to move thee to repentance. Even a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty grounded upon God's word, who cannot lye; and Chriſt's accuſtomed grace to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant ſinners, who being the Son of God, neither can nor will deceive us. Oh then mind, and be moved by them to ſerious and ſpeedy repentance; thy time is ſhort, thy life uncertain, if thou dye in thy ſins, all hope of mercy is for ever gone; lay hold therefore of the preſent opportunity while it is afforded thee, lay hold on eternal life, enter the ſtrait gate, ſet upon the holy race, and ſo run therein as thou mayſt obtain. Men will divers together run in an earthly race for an earthly prize of any great value, though they know before hand that but one of them ſhall obtain it; but in this heavenly race is a heavenly prize exceeding all earthly values, and all that run for it aright are ſure to obtain it; no ones get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it ſhall hinder another that runs with him. Yea (as in the Parable of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in the Vineyard, <hi>Matth. 20.</hi>) they that ſet out a great deal later than others, may yet be at the race end as ſoon, and
<pb facs="tcp:109968:6"/>obtain it as fully and certainly as they that ſet out before them. So that thou mayſt run at a certainty and fight, not as one that beats the Air, but to good purpoſe, if thou wilt but yet be perſwaded to ſet upon this heavenly race, and holy combate, againſt ſin and Sathan. Let the greatneſs of the gain then propoſed, of the pleaſures pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, of the ſatisfaction aſſured, and the greatneſs of the certainty of attaining them in a ſerious turning to God in Chriſt to ſeek after and endeavour for them, draw thee into a ſtedfaſt reſolution of quitting thy ways of ſin and falſhood, and embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and walking on the ways of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſalvation: And do it betimes, and without delay, leaſt thou defer too long, and the Devil, and Sin draw thee on by little and little, till they bring thee inevitably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Perdition.</p>
            <p>But peradventure Satan will ſuggeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, to hinder thee of the good both of theſe my advices, and of the whole fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Treatiſe, ſuch thoughts as ſome men harbour in their hearts (yea, and ſome fear not to utter with their tongues) reaſoning to this purpoſe. All men are under one or other of theſe two abſolute Decrees, either of Election unto life, or of
<pb facs="tcp:109968:7"/>Reprobation to deſtruction, and therefore I muſt needs be under one of them alſo. If I be Elect (as I hope I am) then to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is all your coſt and labour, for its impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for me to miſcarry, what ever I do, and however I live at preſent, my ſins cannot fruſtrate God's decree and purpoſe, nor may you, or any body elſe, lay any ſin to my charge. For <hi>who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's Elect? it is God that juſtifies;</hi> and if he juſtifie me in my preſent ſtate, what need is there for me to repent that I may be justified? or who ſhall condemn me, ſeeing Chriſt's death is for me, and ſhall ſecure me from all my ſins paſt, preſent, and to come, ſo as they cannot harm me? and whereas no unclean thing may inherit God's kingdome, that cannot hurt me; for if I be elected, I ſhall and muſt at one time or other be ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called as againſt all my reſiſtances, and notwithſtanding all my preſent ſinnings, I ſhall obey, and ſo be waſhed and ſanctified, and ſhall againſt all fallings, or poſsibility of falling perſevere in grace to the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the inheritance: And why then may I not take the pleaſure of my ſins while I may, ſeeing they ſhall neither preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice my converſion nor my ſalvation? and
<pb facs="tcp:109968:7"/>if it be not ſo with me, but I am a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, then I cannot be ſaved, though I ſhould endeavour to follow your adviſe and to repent. For then Chriſt dyed not for me, nor hath procured for me, at leaſt, any ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual and ſaving grace; ſome common gifts and graces indeed I may attain, ſome illuminations, good deſires, and half re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentances, which can never tranſlate me from under this ſad Decree, but only will ſerve to aggravate my future wo, while I ſhall ſin againſt the greater light and knowledge. And had I not better take my courſe then, and continue as I am, than put my ſelf upon bootleſs labour, to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, riſing a little higher to fall the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilier, and ſink the deeper into miſery?</p>
            <p>Needful it is to endeavour the removal of theſe reaſonings out of thy mind, which retained will render all good adviſe to thee wholly ineffectual; and ſo</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a hard thing for men to know or think themſelves righteous, yea, though but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively better than ſome of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and not be proud of it; and when men are proud of themſelves, they are very prone to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain others, whom they think not ſo good as themſelves. Yea, and when they ſee God, or his Servants, preferring ſuch upon any account, or in any way of teſtimony thereof before; nay, if but equaliſing them with themſelves, they are apt to envy and fret againſt thoſe perſons therefore: yea, and to fault ſuch Servants of God that ſo do, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to contend againſt God himſelf. For ſuch is the nature of Pride, that it
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109968:18"/>lifts up it ſelf above all, and apts to be angry at, and offended with, what or whoſoever oppoſeth it. All which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations we may make from, and find verified in the Phariſees; who thinking themſelves (though falſly) righteous, diſdained at ſinners, and murmured at Chriſt (himſelf the prime ſervant of God, yea, God himſelf) becauſe of his gentleneſs and goodneſs towards ſinners. So when <hi>Matthew,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Levi,</hi> a Publican, being himſelf converted, made a feaſt for Chriſt and his Diſciples, and invited many Publicans and ſinners to come and eat with him: Chriſt not refuſing their company thereat, but lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of that occaſion, to become their good Phyſitian, for curing thoſe ſpiritual diſeaſes, which threatned their deſtruction, the Pharaſees were offended at him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.10, 11. <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.14.15, 16. <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.27, 28, 29, 30. And ſo was <hi>Simon</hi> the Pharaſee, becauſe he ſuffered a ſinful woman to come ſo near him, as to waſh, and wipe, and kiſs his feet, as he ſat at Dinner with him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.37, 38, 39. And the like temper we find to have been in them here, in what is ſaid of them
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109968:19"/>in the two firſt verſes of this <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. for after Chriſt had informed his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of what they muſt look to part with and forgo, that will be indeed his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and how dangerous it is for thoſe that have begun to follow him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to partake of his vertues, to prove Apoſtates and Backſliders, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14, 25, 34. yet it follows <hi>ver.</hi> 1. of this Chapter. <hi>Then reſorted to him all the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and Sinners to hear him.</hi> As if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all he had told them (as that they who will be his Diſciples muſt, in a ſenſe, hate their deareſt relations and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments, yea their very lives, forſaking all for his ſake, if he call them to it; and that ſuch as forſake him after they have partook of any thing of his vertues are as ſalt that hath loſt its favour, good for nothing, the vileſt of men.) Yet then, for all this, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>All the Publicans and Sinners drew nigh to hear him, and the Phariſees and Scribes murmured, ſaying, This man receiveth ſinners, and eateth with them.</hi> By ſinners meaning ſuch as were notoriouſly ſuch, ſuch, as if called Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as making profeſſion of religion with us, we may not afterward eat with,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109968:19"/>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. till they repent them. It ſeems with ſuch Chriſt eat, being not profeſſedly his Diſciples as yet; and while they were ſuch ſinners; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in teſtified more civility, or familiarity towards them, then the Phariſees in their ſtricter way of Religion could well like of: and therefore they murmured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. But he for vindicating his own charitable demeanor towards thoſe Sinners, ſpake a Parable to them; yea, three Parables, which take up all the reſt of the Chapter. The firſt is, of a man having an hundred Sheep, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing one of them; which the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to ſilence their murmuring, he would have any one of them to make it his own caſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.4, 5, 6. <hi>And he ſpake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them this Parable, ſaying, What man of you having an hundred ſheep, if he loſe one of them, doth not leave the ninty, and nine in the Wilderneſs, and go after that which is loſt, until he findes it; and when he hath found it he layeth it upon his ſhoulders, rejoycing: and when he is come home, he calls together his friends, and neighbours, ſayings, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with me, for I have found my Sheep that was loſt.</hi> His defence is very juſt and pregnant, for what's a Sheep to a Soul?
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109968:20"/>yea, what's one Sheep of an hundred to many ſinful men and women, perhaps almoſt an hundred for one? and if they could not content themſelves with their ninety and nine Sheep ſafe, when but one was miſſing, but that leaving the ninety and nine in the Wilderneſs where they alſo might meet with danger, they would undertake the care and labour of ſeeking one filly Sheep, and ſeek while they finde it, and not be weary with ſeeking it: yea, and would bear the burthen of its weight in bringing it home when found, that they ſo might bring it the ſafelier home, and would make ſuch mirth with coſt for it when its brought home, as to invite their Friends and Neighbours to make merry with them for it: What reaſon had they to be angry at his Charity to the precious Souls of a multitude, every one of which is of a greater value then all their flock of Sheep, an hundred times multiplied? when as alſo his fetching them up expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes not others to any hazzard of their being wronged or loſt in the interim, whatever pains, labour, or coſt it might put upon him to ſeek them up, or what
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109968:20"/>ever burthen to ſuſtain and bring them home, when found by him? when as too, though they were cauſleſly offended, yet thoſe who were far their betters, and before them in hatred of ſin, and love of holineſs, were highly pleaſed. For applying the Parable, he addes, <hi>Verſe</hi> 7. <hi>I ſay unto you, that even ſo there will be joy in heaven over one Sinner that repenteth, more then over ninety and nine juſt perſons who need no repentance.</hi> Not that heaven is not glad for juſt perſons keeping their way, and not offending, ſo as to loſe themſelves; but as their Charity in a ſort leads them to be ſorry for the evil and danger a ſinner brings himſelf into: ſo anſwerable to that ſorrow for that, is their joy the greater when that danger is over, and the object of their Charity hath eſcaped or recovered it: Even as a loving Father, or indulgent Mother ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many Children, is more exerciſed for one of them wen ſick, and in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to dye, or to be loſt: and anſwerably is more glad when that danger is eſcaped then for all the reſt about whom they were not ſo exerciſed. And if there be ſuch joy in heaven for one ſinner that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109968:21"/>ſure then it is a good work to ſeek and endeavour their repentance. And what is it leads any here on earth then to hinder, yea, or grudge at any good endeavour to that purpoſe; or the chearful entertainment of ſuch in their converting into fellowſhip with them? it cannot be their holineſs, or hatred of ſin; for that is found more abundantly in heaven then in any here: therefore it muſt be their Ignorance, Pride, or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond Parable is of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man having ten pieces of Silver, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing one, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>Or what Woman having ten pieces of ſilver, if ſhe loſe one of them, lighteth not a candle, and ſweeps the houſe, and ſeeks diligently till ſhe findes it:</hi> ver. 9. <hi>And finding it, ſhe calls together her friends and neighbours, ſaying, Rejoyce with me, for I have found the piece, that I had loſt.</hi> But why doth our Saviour bring this ſimilitude or parable from the cuſtom of their women? I ſuppoſe his oppoſers, and ſuch as murmured at his gracious carriage towards ſinners were of both Sexes: for ſo we finde the Apoſtles afterward met with oppoſers,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109968:21"/>and perſecutors from amongſt both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like account. In <hi>Acts</hi> 13.50. we finde that when the Apoſtles, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had preached to the Gentiles the Grace of God (and the Gentiles were as loathſome to the Jews as the Publicans and Harlots to the Phariſees) <hi>The Jews ſtirred up devout and honourable women</hi> (or as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> reads it, worſhipping women of good quality) <hi>and the chief men of the City, and raiſed perſecution againſt them, and expelled them out of their Coaſts.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout or worſhipping women, ſuch as were zealous of the Law, and of the Traditions of the Elders, and old Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of their Fore-fathers: Theſe ſeeing <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> like Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks (labouring often with their own hands) and not of their licenſed Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Rabbies, and Doctors, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Doctrine alſo differing from what ſuch taught, and derogating from their Jewiſh Superſtitions and Cuſtoms, and extending the mercy of God to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, they were eaſily ſtirred up in the firſt place, and likely were Inſtruments of ſtirring up the chief men of the City to raiſe perſecution againſt them. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109968:22"/>are uſually full of affection, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and if acted, and ordered by Principles of Truth, and by right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are very uſeful helpers forward of Chriſts Cauſe, and Doctrine: As we read of divers that were helpers with the Apoſtles; but if byaſſed by corrupt Judgment and Affection, if ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ignorantly zealous, they are as fit as any to raiſe up miſchief. And its likely our Lord had ſome murmurings at him from that Sex alſo; and therefore in this Parable he meets with them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing to them, that if they or any of them having but ten Groats, or pieces of Silver (in the Greek, <hi>Drachma,</hi> or a Dram, after one account in value

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109968:22"/>in their purſe, not giving over ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it while they have hope to finde it; and if they finde it, though it ſhould be in the ſink, or in the dirt, they will ſcarce cry faugh, it ſtinks, and throw it quite away, but rather wiping, or waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it clean, put it again in their purſe; and calling their Friends and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors about them, wiſh them to be glad with them, for they have found what was loſt. And yet they would not have our Lord and his Servants value a ſoul ſo much as they do a ſix pence or a ſhilling; ſo as to uſe all means (as by bringing the light of the word, and thereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering and removing their evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings) to ſeek it up and ſave it, and chear and comfort it, or rejoyce over it when found, and recovered. Oh what pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Creatures are we, both men and women, that value ſuch ſmall things better then the ſouls of ſinners! And ſure if a woman would do thus for a ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, what would ſhe not do for ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, or any greater ſumme? And is not a poor ſinful ſoul (much more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) far more to be prized? ſurely yes, and had they wiſdom to their affection,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109968:23"/>they would do ſo too, for their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours and betters do ſo: Our Saviour adding, <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. <hi>So, I ſay unto you, there is joy in the preſence of the Angels of God over one ſinner that repenteth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The third and laſt parable is this, of a part whereof I have choſen to treat, <hi>Verſe</hi> 11. <hi>A certain man had two ſons.</hi> Men will not willingly loſe one ſheep of an hundred if they can by ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it finde it, nor a woman one piece of Silver out of ten. What would any man or woman (for the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> here, is of both Genders, or Sexes, and extends to either man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, though carried on after in the Maſculine, with reference to, and for the fitter reſemblance of God) but what I ſay would any man or woman do think you, if having but two Sons they ſhould loſe one of them? would they not more induſtriouſly ſeek him, and finding him again, would they not be much more glad for him, though they have another beſide, then for a Sheep; and, then a woman, though never ſo great a Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife for a ſix pence? Such the ſcope of this third Parable, in which our Lord
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109968:23"/>ſhews his and his Fathers fatherly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to mankinde as made by him and <hi>as his Off-ſpring</hi> (as the Poet ſaith) deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him; and much more to ſuch as are his by Adoption and ſpecial grace of Regeneration, by and through Jeſus Chriſt, The fruit of the travel of his Soul, and the iſſue of his Word and Spirit vouchſafed to, and working in and upon them.

               </p>
               <p>IT is a true ſaying of <hi>Solomon, He that is firſt in his own cauſe ſeemeth juſt, but his neighbour comes and ſearches him out,</hi> Prov. 18.17. For here we have an anſwer confutes all the Son hath ſaid in his paſſion, and clearly evinces the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Fathers carriage between them, and of his thus entertaining his Son in his return. And firſt, here we may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Fathers meekneſs and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards a froward paſſionate Son, in that he gives him no bad nor angry language. He ſayes not, thou proud and inſolent fellow, that offereſt to make thy ſelf wiſer then thy Father, and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:109968:37"/>up thy ſelf above him, to call him him to an account, and draw a charge againſt him for his actings, as if thou wert wiſer, and of more authority then he; whereas its thy part and place to ſubmit thy ſelf to him, and give him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in judging him wiſe, and righteous in his doings. No ſuch angry ſpeech proceeds from him, but only he gently calls him Son, and gives him a fair an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his charge, and an account of his doings, ſhewing the great conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion and goodneſs of God to his pettiſh people in their ſpiritual Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. He ſees his Son was in a paſſion, and he would not take the courſe further to heat and inflame him, but ſeeks to calm him; like a loving Father, who ſeeing his Childes Body over-heated, and in danger to fall into a Feavour, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſome wayes its prevention: being wiſer then his Son, he ſets not himſelf to anſwer him according to his childiſh folly, but exerciſes love with judgement and diſcretion towards him: and though his Son in his anger would neither vouchſafe to call him Father, nor his Brother, Brother; yet he in whom fury
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:109968:38"/>is not, but Love, Meekneſs, and Charity, will not therefore diſown or provoke him, but pacifie and rectifie him; and therefore calls him Son. Oh the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God, as a loving Father to froward and male contented Children, eſpecially while he ſees their froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs proceeds from ignorance, weakneſs, or the ſtrength of temptation: a pattern worthy imitation. Be we followers of of God as dear children, and walk we in love as Chriſt hath loved us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Shall we weak, purblinde, and ſinful men, be froward with, and harſh to our froward brethren, when through temptation and weakneſs, envyings, ſwellings and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents befal them, when as our great God and Father is ſo graciouſly tender, milde, and gentle to ſuch, yea, to our ſelves, when ſo diſtempered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed towards him.</p>
               <p>But ſee again how blinde paſſion is, though it ſeems to ſee very much, yea, and to ſee more then others that have not their hearts thereby heated and quickned to make diligent obſervation of things before them: It is indeed quick-ſighted of what makes for its
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:109968:38"/>nouriſhment and ſtrengthning in its cauſe: but while it looks upon all ſuch things as it were through Multiplying and Magnifying Glaſſes, and ſees them more and greater then they be, and ſo repreſents them, it is ſo filled with the ſight of them, that it over-looks and ſees not other things before it, that judgement, charity, and right reaſon takes notice of, and the ſight whereof reduces the other things ſeen to their due ſcantling and proportion. For the calm judgment and charity of the wiſe and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Father (the repreſentative of the moſt wiſe and merciful God) ſees and obſerves here what the Son over-lookt, and what might ſtop the mouth of his moſt clamorous paſſion. He was Eagle-eyed to ſee, yea, more than was to be ſeen of his own ſervice and obedience (which yet in this his paſſion he ſhewed but little of) but ſee not, or tookno notice of his better condition, and greater ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligements through his Fathers love and freeneſs towards him; which therefore the loving, meek, and wiſe Father for curing of his diſtemper, mindes him of ſaying, <hi>Son thou art ever with me, and all
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:109968:39"/>that I have is thine</hi> (and what's a Kid or a fatted Calf to an Inheritance) that in his diſtemper was forgotten by him.</p>
               <p>Peeviſh frowardneſs, and paſſionate envious diſtempers are no good guides or counſellors for us to liſten to, or to be led by in our judgements or goings; they ſee where they ſhould be blinde, and are blinde where they ſhould ſee: It is not for us to take notice of our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and obedience, but God who is the wiſer and beſt eſtimator of them, and will not undervalue or underweigh them one grain, nor come ſhort in the leaſt reward of any thing truly accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in them, but is ready to reward them like a bounteous King, ſo as to ſhew his riches of liberality far above any inward excellency they have in them. It is for us, and more behooful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, to minde and take notice of his love and goodneſs to us, to quicken us up to, and in our duties and obedience, and to preſerve us from proud and haughty miſcarriages, and froward repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and murmurings at his dealings with us or others. The minding Gods goodneſs to us will beget and nouriſh
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:109968:39"/>love and obedience in us to him, and then we ſhall not need to minde how dutiful and obedient we are to him, but rather ſhall ſee cauſe to confeſs our ſelves in all we do, unprofitable ſervants to him, that have done nothing but what his goodneſs already extended, challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and makes due from us; and ſo that we cannot challenge any thing of due debt or merit further from him: yet he will alſo, ſuch his goodneſs, minde to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us with rewards undeſerved by us, and exceeding glorious. But as this proud and froward diſtemper made him over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the goodneſs of his condition with his Father and his obligations to him; ſo it blinded him alſo from ſeeing what was meet to be done for, and toward his returned Brother, and the equitableneſs of his Fathers carriage towards him; which therefore his Father to cure him and argue him by reaſon and judgement out of his diſtemper, mindes him of alſo. <hi>It was meet that we ſhould make merry and be glad.</hi> That by his fatherly authority and wiſdom he layes down as a certain truth to be received and believed by his Son, as an Oracle, proceeding from
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109968:40"/>his more perfect underſtanding, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring wiſdom, teaching his Son, who in duty ought to hear his Fathers Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction about what was meet, and not to take upon him to correct his Father, and be an inſtructor and teacher to him. The over-eying, and over-weaning of our graces, ſervices, doings, duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are very apt to, yea, very certainly and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily do puff us up with ſpiritual pride, and that lifts us out of our places and makes us ready to <hi>diſanul Gods Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and condemn the Almighty to juſtifie our ſelves, and make our ſelves righteous.</hi> As God ſayes of <hi>Job</hi> ſinning in that way of ſin through that root of ſpiritual pride, <hi>Job</hi> 40.8. and inſtead of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God and Chriſt, to lift up our ſelves againſt them, quarrel with them, and ſet our ſelves to inform and teach them; doing as St. <hi>Peter</hi> d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:109968:41"/>and Chriſt came not to diſſolve his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Laws, yet we command them to be made and worſhipped, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> While I ſay the Pope and his Councils or any elſe do thus) they are ſo far from being the Rock, Foundation, or the Head of the Church, that they are Satans, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and adverſaries to Chriſt and his Church, and ſo plainly Antichriſts. Yet this the pride of gifts, places, offices, and ſervices puffs up men too uſually to. But the Father would have his froward Son here reduced into better order, and as Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> come behinde him, and hear, and learn of him, not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue againſt him, and rebuke him; as here he did, oppoſing his Fathers pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and order of making merry for his loſt Son found again. <hi>It was meet that we ſhould make merry and be glad.</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a feaſt for mirth, and make mirth outwardly at it, and be glad too inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in heart.</p>
               <p>But he doth not only inſtruct him, and teach him, or by his Fatherly wiſdom and authority dictate ſo much to him; but alſo demonſtrates the truth of his doctrine by ſolid and ſound reaſon, that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:109968:41"/>he might as well inform his judgement, and make him ſee the truth of his ſaying with his own eyes or underſtanding, as it were, as well as aſſure him of it upon his own authority, and the authority of his ſaying, which ought for it ſelf to be received, becauſe he is the Lord, though he gave us no other account of it: and indeed this is one great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Law and the Goſpel. The Law delivers precepts from God barely upon the account of his authority, Thou ſhalt do, or not do thus, for I am the Lord: But the Goſpel inſinuates things to us, and perſwades us to them by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as laying down the grounds and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why, that we might offer to God, <hi>A reaſonable ſervice, Rom.</hi> 12.1. whence alſo as Chriſt is called (<gap reason="foreign">

This thy Son ſaith he to his Father, as if he could be his Fathers Son, and yet not his Brother; or as if a brotherly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation was nothing to challenge and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite compaſſion, love, and affection to him. Oh forſooth, he was ſo holy, juſt, and righteous (above his Father it ſeems) that he diſdained to own him for, or call him his Brother, though his Father had owned and called him Son: as if he would have intimately ſaid, What ſhould I own ſuch a vagabondly Rogue, or riotous Raſcal, or Whoremaſterly Spend-thrift as this for my Brother? As ſome ſuch riotous livers amongſt us in their own eyes would be ready to ſay of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:109968:42"/>ſuch, though they have confeſſed their ſins, and been afflicted for them. Should I believe that God will give pardon, and peace, and aſſurance ſo eaſily to ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants? But the calm unpaſſioned, and loving Father calls him to a calm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, that for all that, whatever he had been, or done, he is yet thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Hath not one God made us? yea, and of one mold, and of the ſame blood, whether Jews, or Gentiles, bond or free, zealous or prophane? yea, did not one Chriſt dye for us? and being called and brought to him, to believe in him, and ſubmit to his grace; are we not all in him that do ſo, juſtified, and made righteous, and the children of God by the faith of Jeſus? whoſe blood waſhes away both the greater ſins of the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Spend-thrifts, and the leſſer mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings and ſpiritual diſtempers of the ſelf-over-weaning Saint, or more righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous liver.

Thou haſt lived pleaſurably to him, and knoweſt not what were the ſad effects of his ſinnings; hadſt thou, thou wouldſt have had more pitty on him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards him. He is my Son, but he was dead; thy Brother, and he was dead: ſo great his ſufferings, ſorrows, and miſeries, as bereft him of all life and ſenſes; he was loſt, no where to be found in Houſe, or Fields, till his own miſeries that he pull'd upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf fell ſo hard upon him, as to make him remember himſelf, and return to me. I and thou might call him, but he was out of the hearing of our voice. My ſervants might call and ſeek him, but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:109968:44"/>he was gone and not to be heard of. Thou loſt nothing by ſerving me, but he loſt all he had, yea, himſelf was loſt by deſerting me, and going from me: didſt thou loſe but a Sheep or Kid, thou wouldſt reſent it, and be troubled for it; yea, thou takeſt it to heart that I have killed the fatted Calf; and was one ſuch creature more to thee then thine own Brother that was dead, and loſt? Oh the mercies of God above our mercies to one another! we ſee and note this and that evil ſuch a one hath done, but God knows the dangers they were in, the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of their hearts, their ſecret ſighs and groans, the throbs and ſobs that they have met with, as the fruits of their ſins, when Gods Spirit hath been remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and withdrawn, or driven from them by their iniquities and rebellions againſt him; the bangs of Conſcience, and bleedings of heart, the fears, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairs, the inward horrors, and outward feelings of correction ſometimes upon them, in loſſes, poverty, or the like; the ſpiritual death and loſtneſs of their ſouls from the feeling of Gods preſence, and the comforts thereof, or any aptneſs
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:109968:45"/>or deſire to any ſpiritual action, and ſo the danger of being loſt for ever. Theſe God hath his eye upon that we ſee not uſually, nor are apt to think on; no, no, we would have them yet kept from God, and his Comforts, and Conſolations, and are ready to ſay, let them bite by it yet, let them rowl themſelves in aſhes, feel the diſpleaſure of God and men againſt them without pitty or comfort inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed; at leaſt for ſome long, long time, till they have made amends for their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked doings, and teſtified ſo much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and amendment as may give us ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. We would not deal ſo with our Sheep; if they through their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring fall into a Ditch, and be almoſt drowned, we would not let them lie there becauſe they ſillily fell in, nor when they are pull'd out, thruſt them in again, or put them into the pin-fold; much leſs with our Children, if they, though contrary to our counſels will ſtraggle and play about till they fall into a Ditch, or Pit, or Oyl-Fat, and be therein drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we will not let them lie becauſe they fell in of their own wantonneſs and careleſſneſs; or having pull'd them out,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:109968:45"/>if they revive, turn them out of doors, and ſtarve them, but tender them, get them to warm Bed, and give them cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials and comfortable things that we judge needful to reſtore their ſtrength again; and ſhould we not do ſo to our poor Brethren after they have been toſt and turmoiled, ſhipwrack't, and dead, and loſt, and are revived again?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This thy Brother was dead, and is alive again, was loſt and is ſound.</hi> The ſame conſideration that led him to receive him and make the feaſt for his entertainment (verſe 23, 24. <hi>For this my ſon was dead and is alive again, was loſt, and is found.</hi>) He propoſes to his Son to quiet him, and to induce him to be content to joyn with them. <hi>This thy Brother was dead, and is alive again, was loſt and is found.</hi> Had he been ſtill dead and loſt, no ground for rejoycing or merriment, but for mourning. We have no cauſe of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, but only and altogether for mourning and lamenting for ſinners, thoſe that erre and live evilly, ſo long as they go on in ſuch their wayes, and are held faſt in the ſnares and cords of their errors and iniquities; but when
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:109968:46"/>they are recovered out of them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned back to God, then we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce for them, and be glad, becauſe of Gods goodneſs therein towards them; and eſpecially when we may perceive God alſo to forgive and comfort them, and to fill them with his conſolations. Such was the caſe of this repenting and recovered Prodigal. He was dead (even he that was my Son, and thy Brother, as if he had ſaid) but he is alive again. He is returned to God, and God and his quickning Spirit are returned to him again; and he is indued with the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of life and grace again; He is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got and brought to hope in, love, and cleave to God, who was hopeleſs, help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and quite gone from God; and he who was loſt whoſe preſence we had not with us, and who walked not in our family and wayes, is reduced, is found again. It is meet therefore now that we be merry and glad.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>Ah, but perhaps the return of this Son may intrench upon the happineſs and riches of the other, he muſt have another portion, and that will diminiſh the Portion of the elder Brother?</hi>

               <head>CHAP. IV. <hi>An enquiry into the meaning of the two Sons.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>BUT firſt it will be needful for us that we may the better underſtand and profit by what is ſet before us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to enquire who are meant by theſe two Sons (chiefly the elder) to whom theſe two Verſes addreſs their contents.</p>
               <p n="1">1. May we take them for Men and Angels, Angels the Elder, and Men the younger Son; indeed both are called, and may be underſtood to be in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:109968:47"/>meant by thoſe titles, the Sons of God. Some underſtand, <hi>Job</hi> 1.6. and 2.1, to ſpeak of Angels, when its ſaid, <hi>The Sons of God preſented themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and Satan came amongſt them:</hi> It may be ſo, and it may be otherwiſe taken. Many of the Ancients thought the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> ſaid in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2. to <hi>Have gone in to the daughters of men,</hi> to have been Angels: and ſo they might be if we by Angels underſtand ſuch as they of the ſeven Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and 3. but ſurely that in <hi>Job</hi> 38.7. that all the Sons of God ſhouted for joy when He laid the foundations of the earth, ſeems neceſſarily to be underſtood of them: And for men its ſaid, <hi>Adam was the Son of God,</hi> as we may conſtrue, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.38. And the Angels were made before men, and ſome of them fell before men too; but of the fallen Angels nothing here can be underſtood. Thoſe that ſtand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſerve God, and keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, being <hi>ready to do his will, hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the voice of his words,</hi> Pſal. 103.19. And man went aſtray from God like a poor loſt. Sheep, and was recovered again in and by Chriſt, who was ſlain
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:109968:48"/>for him, and is become, and is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of God to be mans food: yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand thoſe good Angels to be here meant by the elder Son, becauſe I no where finde they are, or ever were, angry at the goodneſs of God to man in ſeeking his recovery, or entertaining him being recovered, with joy and mirth. No, they are more wiſe, intelligent, and loving Spirits, and fuller of Charity to us then to be offended at Gods goodneſs towards us: they deſirouſly pry, or peep into the myſtery and efficacy of the Goſpel, <gap reason="foreign">

<note place="margin">Beza</note> which ſome render <hi>apud Angelos,</hi> with the Angels: they may rather therefore be included among the houſhold Servants that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Sons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We may apply it to the Jews and Gentiles; The Jews as the elder, the Gentiles as the younger Brother? they both were <hi>made of one blood</hi> indeed,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:109968:48"/>
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 17.26. and ſo are brethren, as one God made them, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.10. and though we read of the Gentiles before any mention of the Jews, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.5. yet the Jews being firſt called to, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (even in and from their fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) with the knowledge of God and his Myſteries after ſuch a diſtinction of of two peoples found in the world; and God calling them his firſt born (<hi>Iſrael is my firſt-born,</hi> Exod. 4.21, 22.) they may be underſtood by the eldeſt Son to whom alſo God gave himſelf, and with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf all things, to be their Inheritance; and they were comparatively to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles keepers of the Law: and we finde that many of them did over-wean their ſervices to God according to the Law, and were often ready to expoſtulate with God like the eldeſt Son here upon that account, that <hi>they faſted, and he regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> it not, <hi>ſought him,</hi> but he <hi>took no notice of them,</hi> that they <hi>ſerved him in vain, and walked mournfully before the Lord of Hoſts, and kept his ordinance;</hi> yet he loved and eſteemed them not. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.2, 3. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.2. and 3.13, 14, 15. they took alſo great offence, and ſtumbled at
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:109968:49"/>the Gentiles Converſion and reception into the Church of God by the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles, and upon that account partly ſtand out ſtill: Whence its ſaid, <hi>They are enemies to the Goſpel for the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſake,</hi> Rom. 11.28. all this may be ſaid for this interpretation, and may render it probable that there was ſome eye upon them in this parable: But yet ſeeing there was no colour for their ſaying, that they had ſerved God many years, and never at any time tranſgreſſed againſt his Commandments, and that he never gave them a Kid, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> it being manifeſt that they were very rebellious againſt him, as to the body of them, and often tranſgreſſed by Idolatry and otherwiſe, and were many of them as prophane and bad as the Gentiles; and Chriſt was Crucified for that Nation, though not for that Nation only, <hi>John</hi> 11.51, 52. yea, the feaſt of fat things firſt made for, and tendered to them, they the firſt bidden and invited Gueſts: yea, and they firſt rejected that Feaſt before the Gentiles were preached to, and invited in; and their firſt ſtanding out was not upon that account; nay rather, becauſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:109968:49"/>they firſt ſtood out the Goſpel was ſent to the Gentiles. Whence its ſaid, <hi>That the fall of them was the riches of the world,</hi> and that <hi>through their fall, ſalvation is come to the Gentiles, and the caſting them away is the reconciling of the world,</hi> Rom. 11.11, 13, 15. All which ſayings imply that they firſt ſtumbled at Chriſt, and the preaching of Chriſt before the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were called in. As to that purpoſe alſo thoſe paſſages in <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.7, 8, 9. <hi>Luke</hi> 14.20, 21. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.46, 47, 48. and 28, 27, 28. ſpeak; therefore it doth not ſo properly ſeem, and ſo fully to agree to them generally conſidered, though in ſome ſenſe as ſtumbling at the call of the Gentiles alſo, and being offended at the Goſpel preaching to them it may be applied to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Or may we apply it to the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees and Publicans? indeed that it took its riſe and occaſion of being propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from, becauſe the Phariſees who thought themſelves righteous and in a ſenſe were ſo comparatively to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans (that is in reſpect of their obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and ſtrictly cleaving to the Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and abſtaining from all groſſer
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:109968:50"/>ſins that were notorious, and taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by men as ſuch) were offended at Chriſt for his Grace to the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and Harlots, who were evidently breakers of Gods Laws, and walked contrary thereto, and all of them were of that people that had the adoption, and the name of Gods Sons upon them; ſo as the Gentiles in diſtinction from the Jews had not, and the Publicans and Harlots entred into the Kingdom of God before them, as our Saviour ſayes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21, 32. and they and the Phariſees are repreſented by our Saviour in <hi>ver.</hi> 38. by two Sons of one man: but then the Phariſees there are compared to the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Son that ſaid to his Father, that he would go into his Vineyard and went not, whereas the other ſaid the contrary, yet repented and went; they repenting at the preaching of <hi>John,</hi> and betaking themſelves alſo to Chriſt, as the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees did not, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.29, 30. I think though it may be applied to them, and our Saviour ſpeaks it to them, and in their hearing, for their Inſtruction, yet there can hardly be a full accommodation of that in <hi>ver.</hi> 31. to them, that they were
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:109968:50"/>Gods Sons, and were ever with him, and all he had were theirs. Chriſt (at leaſt afterward) uſed to ſpeak at a rougher rate to them, yea, and <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt before calling them Serpents, a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Vipers, Hypocrites, yea, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Hell, and the Devil: But there might be difference of them; ſome that were not ſuch oppoſers of Chriſt and his Doctrine; ſuch as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> that came to him by night, and <hi>Simon,</hi> whoſe debts he ſeems to imply were forgiven him, though not ſo great and many as the womans that he called and looked upon as a ſinner, an infamous woman, and inwardly murmured at Chriſts gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs towards, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.36, 37, 42, 43, &amp;c. Others were proud, ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful oppoſers, and perſecutors of Chriſt and his truth, truſting in themſelves that they were righteous, and in the right way, and condemning him of error and deceit; and thoſe he calls Serpents, and generation of Vipers, Children of Hell, and of the Devil: and if we ſo look upon it, and apply it to the firſt ſort of them (of which alſo <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be one, even after he was a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:109968:51"/>Chriſtian and an Apoſtle. I am a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee, the Son of a Phariſee, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.6, that word ſignifying but one ſeparated to the ſtudy and obſervation of the Law of God, the ſtricteſt Sect of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion amongſt the Jews; much what like what uſed to be called amongſt us, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans, and now Presbyterians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſome of whom doubtleſs may be, and were honeſt and good Chriſtians) then it will agree to another ſenſe, that I am moſt ſatisfied in, and think to be the righteſt and fulleſt, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. By the two Sons I underſtand two kindes of people both begotten to, and born of God, adopted by him for his Children, through Jeſus Chriſt, either as implicitly held forth, as before his coming, or explicitly as ſince; one of theſe compared to the younger Son are they that after ſome time taking, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing the Gifts and Graces of God to themſelves, and conſidering and growing full in themſelves through them, depart from God, and run into by-paths, and ſinful courſes, tending to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their ſouls, waſting and conſuming Gods gift, and talents upon
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:109968:51"/>their own and other mens luſts. The other ſort compared to the elder Son, ſuch as after grace received, and their call and birth as it were into, or in Gods houſe, abide therein, and cleave to God, and his word, and the commands and councels thereof walking juſtly and holily with God in the main, and not departing from him, as open ſinners do; for unto ſuch it may be ſaid, as is here ſaid by the Father more fully and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly. Son thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith of ſuch, <hi>Bleſſed are the undefiled in the way that walk in the Law of the Lord. Bleſſed are they that keep his teſtimonies, and ſeek him with the whole heart; they alſo do no iniquity that walk in thy wayes,</hi> Pſal. 119.1, 2, 3. Men that are truly righteous and accepted of God, and turn not aſide to crooked paths as others do.</p>
               <p>Only here it might be queſtioned, whether ſuch perſons may be guilty of ſuch pride and frowardneſs as is here ſet forth in the elder Son and his carriage; ſuch diſdain at erring and repenting Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſuch quarrelling at God and his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:109968:52"/>dealings. And it ſeems to me they may, and ſometimes have been found, and yet are guilty of ſuch like diſtempers through their over-weaning their own righteouſneſs, and walkings, and diſlike, as they apprehend of others wickedneſs. Yea, we have divers inſtances of ſuch like frowardneſs befalling and exerting it ſelf in ſuch more cloſe-walking Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and righteous perſons upon divers accounts: as to ſay.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sometimes becauſe they ſee and perceive, and with a carnal eye (which yet may be in true and right Diſciples; elſe Chriſt would not have ſaid to ſuch, If thy right eye offend thee pluck it out and caſt it from thee) do behold and look upon the outward proſperity, riches, honours, and welfare of looſe ungodly perſons that are and continue to be ſo; and on the other hand reflect upon their own ſufferings and troubles: Thus we finde that good man <hi>Aſaph</hi> confeſſing to us that ſuch a view of things had like to have turn'd him aſide, and made him ſlip: yea, it brought him to ſuch a paſs as that he was actually <hi>envious at the fooliſh when he ſaw the proſperity of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:109968:52"/>wicked,</hi> and came to this concluſion, <hi>Verily in vain have I cleanſed my heart, and waſhed my hands in innocency, for all the day long have I been plagued and chaſtned every morning,</hi> Pſal. 73.13, 14. Whence alſo ſo frequent warnings and councels given to ſuch by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Not to envy ſinners, nor fret them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves becauſe of ſuch as proſper in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and that bring evil devices to paſs;</hi> as is to be ſeen in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.29, 31. and 23.17, 18. and 24.1.19, 20. and the ſame carnal eye that leads to envy and be diſcontented at God for the outward proſperity of the openly wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, may lead them to ſtumble and be diſpleaſed at God for giving ſuch upon their repentance more gracious teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of his love, and raviſhing ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and aſſurance of Salvation then they have proved or felt in their more ſober and zealous walking.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes becauſe God doth heavily try and exerciſe them with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward troubles and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; therefore over-weaning their own integrity, righteouſneſs, and good do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, they are ready to expoſtulate with
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:109968:53"/>God, and condemn and fault him as much as this elder Brother his righteous Father: and this was <hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, and weakneſs: ſure it is that he was no Phariſee (as that word is uſed to ſignifie a ſeemingly righteous man only, and a real Hypocrite) for he hath teſtimony from God that he was a perfect man, and upright above any in the Land, one fearing God, and eſchewing evil; and he could in truth (and did) ſay a great deal of his uprightneſs and integrity, his holy, blameleſs, and good demeanor, in <hi>chap.</hi> 29. and 31. more then any man ſcarce can ſay I believe, and ſo much as put to ſilence the jealous and falſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and groundleſs charges of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful friends that would have faſtned upon him the blame of hypocriſie and wickedneſs; and yet he over-valuing his righteouſneſs, and looking, and ſtanding too much upon it, fell into this diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, to murmur againſt, and fault the Almighty, <hi>condemning him, and diſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling his judgement, that he might be righteous:</hi> as this froward Son did, faulting God, in vindication of his own integrity; as if God puniſhed him
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:109968:53"/>without cauſe, and did more to him then he could anſwer; and if a perfect upright man through temptation may fall into ſuch a proud and froward di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper in one caſe, it may be poſſible alſo in another.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But we have inſtances too of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and good men, charging God fooliſhly, and murmuring againſt men for his and their reſpect to penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and for his equalizing or ſeeming to prefer them in his kindneſs, who were below them in their works of righteouſneſs, and over eſtimated good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: A three-fold inſtance at the leaſt we have of this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The believing Jews when they heard that <hi>Peter</hi> had gone in to <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius (Acts</hi> 11.1.) and eaten and drunk with them that were profeſſed Gentiles, that is, uncircumciſed perſons, murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at him for it, and took him to task, till by repeating the whole matter, with its grounds and reaſons to them, he gave them ſatisfaction; and then they indeed acquieſced, and glorified God for giving unto them alſo repentance unto life; but before they contended
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:109968:54"/>with, and accuſed him, and that's all that we finde this Son did to his Father; and as they, after St. <hi>Peter</hi> had opened the matter to them acquieſced, ſo might this Son after this defence made by his Father; for-we finde no reply thereto made by him, nor further mention of him, as we do of the zealous Jews af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward that were Chriſtians, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

The labourers firſt hired into the Vineyard, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.1, 11. when they came to receive their pay, becauſe they that were hired at the eleventh hour of the day, receiving their pay firſt, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as much as they, who had been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red early in the morning, murmured againſt the Maſter of the houſe, as if he had done them wrong, in making them who had <hi>laboured but a little while</hi> equal in their pay with them <hi>who had born the burden and heat of the day,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Theſe have wrought but one hour, and thou haſt made them equal with us</hi> ver. 12. and yet theſe appear to have been righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous perſons; for in his anſwer he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts not againſt their ſaying, <hi>they had born the burthen and heat of the day,</hi> as accuſing them of falſhood in their plea,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:109968:54"/>and as if they had been unrighteous loyterers, and not labourers, and they were rewarded for their work according to agreement, and promiſe, and had the ſame reward as thoſe laſt that ſeemed to be more favoured: Their exception againſt him was not that they had leſs then he had promiſed them, or then they had been content at firſt to labour all the day for, but only that he made the laſt that had wrought ſo little a time equal with them, to whom therefore all his anſwer is, <hi>Friend I do thee no wrong, didſt thou not agree with me for a peny? is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? is thine eye evil becauſe mine is good? take that thine is, and go thy way, I will give to this laſt as unto thee,</hi> ver. 13, 14, 15. Indeed this is not altogether the ſame caſe: but if righteous reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perſons (ſuch as the Apoſtles, for ſo the occaſion of the parable which was St. <hi>Peters</hi> taking notice of what they had done, for Chriſt ſeems to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it) may in conſideration of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and Gods bounty to others that have laboured leſs, fall into ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers for his goodneſs to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

               <p n="3">3. The Prophet <hi>Jonah</hi> undoubtedly was a good and gracious man, being a Prophet of the Lord, and a Type of Chriſt, and yet he fell into a peeviſh diſtemper, like to this of this elder Son, becauſe God had not more reſpect to him, and his honour, and credit, as a Prophet (as he thought its likely it would tend to his diſparagement) then to repenting <hi>Nineveh</hi> which was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him before their repentance to be deſtroyed after forty dayes time. The repenting <hi>Ninivites</hi> were like this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting Prodigal, <hi>They believed Gods threatning, and repented, and put away their evil works; and God alſo repented of the evil which he had threatned to bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and deſtroyed them not.</hi> And as the Fathers entertainment of his Son diſpleaſed the elder Brother here: ſo did Gods mercy and indulgence to <hi>Nineveh</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:109968:55"/>diſpleaſe <hi>Jonah</hi> there: for it is ſaid, <hi>The thing diſpleaſed Jonah exceedingly</hi> (as if it had been ſome great evil that had befallen him) <hi>and he was angry with him, and he prayed unto the Lord and ſaid,</hi> Jonah 4. <hi>I pray thee, O Lord, was not this the ſaying that I ſaid while I was yet in mine own Land; therefore fled I before unto Tarſhiſh? for I knew that thou art gracious, and merciful, long-ſuffering, and of great kindeneſs, and repenteſt thee of the evil: and now, O Lord, take I beſeech thee my life from me, for it is better for me to die then to live.</hi> What a peeviſh froward temper was this good man in, that could have been content to have died for grief that <hi>Nineveh</hi> was ſpared? whence the Lord ſaid to him, <hi>Doeſt thou well to be angry?</hi> and ſhewed him his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in that, when <hi>Jonah</hi> went out of the City, and ſate and abode on the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of it, and had made a Booth, and ſate under it till he might ſee what would become of the City; and God had prepared a Gourd, which grew up above <hi>Jonah,</hi> and was a ſhade to him, defending him from the heat of the Sun,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:109968:56"/>ſo that he was exceeding glad of it: He alſo prepared a worme, that on the morrow ſmote the Gourd that it wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and in the morning he prepared an Eaſt-winde that was drying, and the Sun beat upon <hi>Jonah's</hi> head, ſo as he fainted, ſo as he then deſired to dye ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to live: whereupon the Lord ſaid to him, <hi>Doeſt thou well to be angry for the Gourd,</hi> and he in his great fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs replyed, <hi>I do well to be angry to the death,</hi> juſtifying himſelf in his frowardneſs as this Elder Son did; as if God had done him a double injury, one, in being ſo merciful to that cruel, bloody, heatheniſh City, and another in being ſo harſh to him, as to take away the comfort and ſhelter of the Gourd from him, thereby expoſing him to ſo much trouble; much what as this Elder Son quarrelled with his Father for his ſuppoſed ſtraitneſs to him, and for his goodneſs to his Brother, till God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him there as the Father did his Son here, to allay his heat and paſſion, ſaying, <hi>Thou haſt pitty on that Gourd that thou never labouredſt for, neither didſt thou make it to grow, but it ſprung up in a night,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:109968:56"/>and periſhed in a night, and ſhould not I have mercy on Nineveh, a great City, in which are more then ſix ſcore thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which know not their right hand from their left, beſides much Cattle?</hi> Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as our Lord in theſe Parables) how apt men are to be pittiful towards, and tender over trifles, and yet they are ready to take it ill, that God ſo tenders, and ſhews his compaſſion to the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſouls of his choice creatures.</p>
               <p>Indeed there was a difference between <hi>Jonah</hi> and this Elder Son, if we take for true his paſſionate proclaiming his own dutifulneſs and obedience. <hi>Jonah</hi> could not ſay as he, that he never at any time tranſgreſſed any of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; for he had but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>before gone quite contrary to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, flying to <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> when God ſent him at the firſt to preach to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> for which God made him ſmart, by cauſing him to be caſt into the Sea, where he had periſhed had he not upon his repentance and crying to God found wonderous mercy from him, in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring a Whale, and cauſing it after three dayes and three nights to vomit
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:109968:57"/>him out upon the ſhore, ſafe and ſound. But this was ſuch a circumſtance as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the caſe far more for our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; for one would have thought that ſuch a notable tranſgreſſion deſerving ſuch, and a greater puniſhment, and putting him upon ſuch a need of cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for mercy himſelf, and ſuch a ſignal unparallel'd mercy obtained of God, ſhould have made him more to compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate others that ſinned, and more well-pleaſed, that they ſhould in their repentance obtain mercy too. Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of miſeries uſe to make men more compaſſionate to others, and mercies ſhewed to our ſelves ſhould make us more deſirous of mercy to others, whom like or worſe miſeries have either layen upon, or are at preſent impending over: but it was otherwiſe with <hi>Jonah,</hi> he that had needed and cryed for, and obtained mercy for himſelf but a little before, without which he had been no more heard of, even he hardens his heart againſt ſuch as needed like mercy now, and could be angry unto death, that God ſhould take ſuch care to call them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and upon their repenting
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:109968:57"/>ſpare them. Now if truly righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons after great lapſes themſelves, and mercies received, may murmur at Gods mercies to others, becauſe they obtain mercy upon repentance, who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſerved to have been deſtroyed: how much more may it befall ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, having in their apprehenſions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo offended, or been in ſuch a plunge, but alwayes in a poſture of duty and obedience, being puft up thereby to fall into paſſions and offences, to ſee groſs ſinners upon an appearingly ſlighty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, received to ſuch favours as they have never had experience of the like?</p>
               <p>Theſe things ſeem to render valid the interpretation of the words that I have given; beſides the words themſelves anſwered here by the Father to his fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Son; Son thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine, which agree unto none ſo properly as unto truly righteous, and obedient Children. And the words ſo looked upon, though they do not ſuit juſt with the generality of the Jews or Phariſees, who were Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, nor may be ſo conſtrued as to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:109968:58"/>render them truly righteous; yet by an argument from the greater to the leſs, do more ſtrongly reprove them after this ſort. If perſons truly righteous, and in the main dutiful and obedient, have no cauſe to murmur at Gods great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies towards grievous ſinners, if upon their repentance they be not only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, but alſo meet with ſuch joyes and expreſſions of gladneſs in God and his Servants, as themſelves never had proof and experience of; much leſs have formal Profeſſors, carnal Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, or Hypocrites, that have nothing but a form of Worſhip, and an appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Godlineſs and Devotion, and that mixed too, with great blindeneſs, oppoſition to Chriſt, his wayes and truth, and with many other great latent evils (and ſome open enough too ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) much leſs I ſay have ſuch cauſe to murmur at Gods mercies to penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and think themſelves ſlighted in that their formal, out-ſide, and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Profeſſions are leſs regarded: foraſmuch as their formal Devotion and Religion is far ſhort of the groſſer Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners hearty repentance and turning unto
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:109968:58"/>God. Such ſinners might ſay to them, as the Thief upon the Croſs to his fellow that mocked at Chriſt, <hi>Feareſt thou not God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> in as bad a condition by thy reſting in an ignorant, formal, out-ſide profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without inward life and power, and therein indulging thy ſelf in ſome ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly leſs, but as well forbidden corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions (ſuch as their ſwearing by the Temple, and by the Altar, and thinking themſelves guiltleſs therein, when God had forbidden to ſwear, ſave by his Name, and by his Name too, cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, raſhly, or falſly; ſomewhat like mens ſwearing by their Faith and Troth, or by the Maſs, or by the Name of God cuſtomarily, and ſuch other Oaths in which they hold themſelves innocent, <hi>Mat</hi> 23.16, 17, 18, 19) Yea and adding to thy other ſins that that makes thee equal with the chief ſinners, <hi>viz.</hi> oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Gods Wayes, Truths and people, even to the Name of his only Son, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon by them (as <hi>Paul</hi> tells us when he had reckoned up many great ſinners, as ungodly, unholy, prophane, murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Fathers, murtherers of Mothers,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:109968:59"/>Whoremongers, defilers of themſelves with mankinde, Man-ſtealers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for whom he ſayes Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave them; yet ſpeaking of himſelf that had been of the ſtraiteſt Sect of Religion among the Jews, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred and hated thoſe groſſer wayes of ungodlineſs; yet becauſe he had in his ignorant zeal for God and his Church, and the Traditions of the Elders, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed Chriſt, and his Truth, and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and been a perſecutor of, and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ro them: he ſtiles himſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>the chief of ſinners,</hi> (as if a greater ſinner then thoſe Thieves, Whoremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and Murtherers before ſpoken of by him) thou I ſay art in as bad a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as I poor prodigal was in before I repented, and how much worſe then now I am, in having repented; ſuch as are ſo far guilty themſelves (as the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees more generally had a ſpice of that perſecuting ſpirit againſt Chriſt and his Doctrine) have I ſay no cauſe to murmur againſt Gods goodneſs to repentant ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but had need rather to repent them with them that they might obtain like mercy alſo: as our Saviour implies
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:109968:59"/>that the Publicans and Harlots repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and being thereupon admitted into Gods Kingdom, and ſo into a ſtate of <hi>righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt</hi> (Rom. 14.17.) ſhould have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Phariſees to repentance with them of their formal and phariſaical righteouſneſs, and other ſinful evils found with them. To that purpoſe is what is written in <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.31, 32. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that the Publicans and Harlots go into the Kingdom of God before you</hi> (before you Phariſees, formal Profeſſors, ſuperſtitiouſly righteous) <hi>for John came unto you in the way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and ye believed him not; but the Publicans and the Harlots believed him: and ye when ye had ſeen it, repented not that ye might believe.</hi> I do not ſay then that all that murmur at Gods goodneſs to repenting Sinners, are really righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and the Sons of God. No, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the Scribes and Phariſees were not ſo, nor were the falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and the Preachers up of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Primitive Churches ſuch, who were greatly offended at the Gentiles finding ſuch mercy as to be received in,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:109968:60"/>in their uncircumciſion in the fleſh, into the number of Gods Saints, and holy ones. The Apoſtle gives them other Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, when he ſayes, <hi>Beware of dogs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of evil workers, beware of the conciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> Phil. 3.2. and ſayes of ſuch, <hi>That their end was deſtruction,</hi> ver. 19. and that they were <hi>falſe Apoſtles, deceitful workers, meſſengers, and Miniſters of Sathan,</hi> and the like, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13, 14, 15. But I ſay ſuch as cleave to God their Father, and depart not from him in faith or life, that are ever with him, and have inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in all he hath, theſe are truly righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous perſons through Chriſt in the main, though they alſo may poſſibly be ſometimes leavened with the leaven of the Phariſees, their corrupt principles or wayes, if they take not heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as is implyed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.6. they may have froward, ſullen, peeviſh, and envious fits befal them: yea, and beſides, our Saviour for better winning in the Phariſees, and taking off their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, might (and I think did ſometime) ſpeak to them upon ſuppoſal of their being (what they judged themſelves to be) truly righteous: as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.13.

               <p n="1">1. Men might be called the Sons of God by virtue of their Creation, in which they received their being of, and from God, much more then a childe his being from his Parents; and ſo (as we noted before) its ſaid, <hi>The Son of Adam, which was the Son of God,</hi> Luke 3.38. and by the Poet recited and approved by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 17.28, 29. <hi>For we are alſo his off-ſpring:</hi> from which the Apoſtle infers, <hi>foraſmuch then as we are the off-ſpring of God, we ought not to think that the God-head is like to Gold,</hi> &amp;c. For indeed God made man in his own Image and Likeneſs, and therefore alſo man reſembling God in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, as the Son the Father, might there-from be called and accounted his Son.

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="4">4. Yea, what folly and madneſs muſt they needs be guilty of, that having in and through Chriſt way made, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage afforded for attaining this dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, either take up ſo much content in being the children of ſome mortal rich or great ones, or in having ſuch earthy eſtates, pleaſures, or fading enjoyments; or elſe are ſo taken up with care to get, and keep ſome earthy worldly things that will not either ſatisfie or ſave them, that they utterly neglect and trample un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feet like Swine, or very luke-warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and coldly ſeek after, and ſo miſs for want of more hearty ſeeking, ſuch a pearl of ſo infinite value as this is? as if there were more in being the Sons or Daughters of Gentlemen, Knights, or Princes, or more in a few periſhing riches, deceitful pleaſures, or empty titles, or honours, then in being the

                  <hi>THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> art ever with me.</hi> They that are obedient to God and Chriſt, and depart not away through pride and folly from him, have the advantage of being ever with him: For God doth not (as other Fathers ſometimes do) ſend away his Children to live from him; they that forſake not him ſhall not be forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or thruſt away by him. <hi>They that come unto Chriſt,</hi> and ſo unto God in Chriſt, <hi>he will in no wiſe caſt them away,</hi> or loſe them, <hi>John</hi> 6.33. and 18.9. Other Fathers that have divers Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren muſt ſend ſome of them away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they either want love for them all, or if not, yet have not alwayes room for them all in their Houſes and Farms, or the like; but its not ſo with God, he hath room enough in his heart for them
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:109968:73"/>all, and room, and bread, and proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on enough in his houſe for them all too, and for more then all. The ſame love that led him to beget them through the painful ſufferings of his Son, and the troubleſome travels of his Soul, and by the powerful influences of his Spirit, leads him alſo to keep and look to them.</p>
               <p>And thus they are in and by vertue of Chriſt, who is their Head, and in whom they are as Branches in the Stock or Root, <hi>John</hi> 15.4. as members in the Head, or in union with it by Faith and Spirit, being in Chriſt they are in him ever with God; for he is ever with him in his preſence, in his boſom, at his right hand, in his power and authority, ruling and ordering all things, for, and over, and about them; and as the great High-Prieſt making interceſſion for them.</p>
               <p>We were with God, even all men in our firſt Parents in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> injoying intercourſe with him, till we in them offended, and ſinned, and then he juſtly caſt us out thence as unclean and naſty creatures, and baniſhed us from his preſence, ſetting a Cherubim, with a
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:109968:74"/>flaming Sword in his hand to keep us thence: yet not content to leave us ſo, in his pitty and mercy he deviſed a way, a new and living way, by which he might without violation to his truth and juſtice (which ſtood againſt us as in our ſelves become ſinners) admit us again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his preſence, and have intercourſe with us. To that purpoſe he ſent his Son into the world for us, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came as a baniſhed perſon from his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence for a time, crying out as forſaken of his Father; that ſo taking away the ſentence of baniſhment by ſatisfying the demands of Law and Juſtice in his own body for all men (as fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore expelled from him) he might become himſelf the way of acceſs (the fiery flaming Sword in the hand of the Cherubim that was every way wielded againſt us, being removed by his being made under, and bearing the ſentence of the fiery Law for us) and by him now we may return to God again. <hi>He hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for us, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18. To which purpoſe being raiſed again, and become the mediator of God and us, he
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:109968:74"/>calls us by him to himſelf; and though we are ſo unclean in our ſelves, that he can admit us to no immediate fellowſhip with himſelf, yet in and by him, <hi>Who is the way, the truth, the life, the new and living way,</hi> that makes alive and clean, righteous and holy, all that enter into, and walk in him, and ſo come unto God by him (he being <hi>made to us of God, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, and Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</hi>) there he can ſpeak to, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with us, from off that mercy-ſeat, and admit us to behold him, preſent our ſelves to and before him, and have moſt intimate and intire fellowſhip with him, and no way, or where elſe. By him, as the door and gate of life opened for all (though ſtrait to the fleſh, becauſe of its croſſneſs to its corrupt wiſdom, will, and affections, and becauſe of the many reproaches, perſecutions, and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons attending it, ſo as few finde and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it) he invites all to return to God again, <hi>Commanding all men</hi> by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel <hi>every where to repent,</hi> Acts 17.30: and ſending forth his Spirit with his calls, in which he ſtretcheth forth his hand and power, that thereby men

There is a ſpending, conſuming, or dying of the ſpiritual gifts or efficacies of the Spirit of Life formerly infuſed and found in them; though there may be for a time ſomewhat of theſe abiding, as it is in a branch, that though the life of it be gone, yet ſomething of the ſap and greenneſs, the effects of that life, abide for a time, and go away by degrees, <hi>John</hi> 15.5, 6. and as the heat in a dead body, after the life and ſoul is gone, yet ſomething of the heat and warmth often abide that was the effect of the ſoul and life while there, but that's decreaſing too, and goes away at laſt; and this may be ſignified in the Parable by the Prodigals ſpending his portion or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in riotous living: it was not all gone ſo ſoon as gone from his Father, but it ſoon after went away, and was ſpent; though yet the rational ſenſe as a

When the Doctrine of God, and the Spirit of God and Chriſt are gone once, and the ſavour of his Grace loſt, though there may be yet too a form of Prayers, Faſting, and outward formalities and obſervances; yet then they are all <hi>dead works,</hi> Heb. 9.14. as a <hi>menſtruous cloth,</hi> a filthy thing, <hi>The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 15.8. and 21.27.

               <p n="7">7. And then as dead bodies they are ſeparated from the living; from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, and his living Houſhold and Family. God cannot endure to look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them with any delight or likement of them, or have them in his ſight or preſence: they are condemned of him, loathed and deteſted, as to their dead eſtate by him, cut off from him, and

               <p n="2">2. And ſo (if they be not through ſome miraculous mercy revived) they be dead as to body; not only in that they muſt as all others come to a natural death in the appointed time, but often are alſo expoſed to, in danger of, and ſometimes taken away by judicial deaths, as either in ſome judgement or teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of wrath from God, as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when drowned in the Red Sea, <hi>Saul</hi> conquered by the Philiſtines, and ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, and many of the Rebellious Iſraelites deſtroyed in the Wilderneſs; or elſe as ſometimes by ſome judicial deaths from men, as <hi>Zedekiah</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> whom the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> roſted in the fire, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.22.

               <p n="3">3. Eternal death of body and ſoul wholly caſt out and ſeparated from God, and from his preſence into everlaſting miſery and torments, both in ſouls and bodies for ever, in which is both a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect loſs and deprival of all good things both bodily and ſpiritual; and alſo a perfect and eternal ſubjection to all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and miſchief, pain, ſorrow, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable torment upon ſoul and body for ever: a ſad and doleful portion of the workers of iniquity, and of thoſe that having been quickned up to a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life let it ſlip again, and depart from it by going away from the Doctrine of Chriſt, and ſo from Chriſt and the Holy Spirit, and ſo finally perſiſt; but this laſt was through mercy here prevented.

An inward ſpiritual ſenſe, minde, and remembrance of things that in the ſtate of death were forgotten, and not thought of or apprehended as we finde this dead Prodigal reviving calls to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance what he thought not on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, at leaſt with any livingneſs; as that he had a Father, and a Fathers Houſe, in which were many hired Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and bread enough for them all,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:109968:125"/>and to ſpare, and that he periſht there for hunger. Now he is awakened both to a ſenſe of his ſtate, and to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, where he may finde relief; or rather this was as <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> infuſed into him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An inward deſire and breathing after that relief and help that he is made apprehenſive of, and whereof he had had before the taſte and experiment; for that's implyed in his reſolving to go to his Father for it, that he deſired and breath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d after it. So the ſinner brought into minde and remembrance of God and his goodneſs in Chriſt, in his revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving again hath effected in him a deſire to finde that goodneſs again, which he had proved before, and that he hath again heard of, and remembers. And this is a gaſping for life and breath again upon the <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> or Water of Life infuſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An inward hope that he may be made partaker thereof again in giving diligence to return to God in Chriſt for it, and to ſeek it in him, and in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and love towards him; and indeed therein life is more compleatly entred, or
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:109968:126"/>breath recovered; and the ſoul more properly lives in the receiving this hope, and having it begotten in the heart, and though it be but of a poſſibility, and ſome likelihood of being made a parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of ſatisfaction again in God and Chriſt. Whence proceeds and ſprings as a further action of life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. An inward purpoſe and reſolution of quitting his preſent poſture, in which this thought of God and his goodneſs coming upon it, found it. This ſtate of ſinning, keeping Swine, maintaining and nouriſhing bruitiſh luſts, affections, and appetites; in the objects whereof the Soul and ſpirit findes no ſatisfaction, together with a purpoſe to riſe up from under thoſe diſcouraging complaints and deſpairs, under which it before lay pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and to betake it ſelf by faith and repentance unto God its Father, from whom and whoſe houſe it had departed, and to confeſs its ſin, and vileneſs, and ſubmit it ſelf to his diſpoſing. <hi>I ſaid I will confeſs my ſin,</hi> Pſal. 32.4, 5. <hi>I will ariſe and go to my Father, and I will ſay to my Father, Father I have ſinned againſt heaven, and before thee, and am not
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:109968:126"/>worthy to be called thy Son, make me as one of thy hired Servants,</hi> This like the moving and ſtretching himſelf when a perſon is come to himſelf, and revives.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A putting that reſolution into practice, ſtrengthning thoſe things that they might not dye again, by ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring his Father, and ſtill retaining in minde, the fulneſs of his Fathers houſe, and his great goodneſs to all therein, of whatſoever condition; and ſo he roſe up both from his ſinful way, practiſe, ſtate, and condition, and from his pining away in himſelf, and in the poring upon his own want, and wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chedneſs, and betook himſelf towards his Father by faith and repentance; like the revived man's turning himſelf that he may get up.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Being thus made alive by the Grace of God underſtood and yielded to as common, in its gracious workings in the ſoul, as infuſing principles of life, while he is yet but begun to act and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe that life, in putting ſin reſolutions into performances, his Father ſees him, and pitties him, and runs, meets, imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and kiſſes him: that is, while the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:109968:127"/>ſoul is thus turning to God, and going back towards him in the exerciſe of faith and repentance, though but in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings. God in the greatneſs of his compaſſion and goodneſs cloſes with it, returns to it, accepts it, incourages and helps it, and ſpeaks comfortably to it, kiſſes it with the kiſſes of his mouth, and therein further puts life and ſtrength in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, making it more to hope for his pardon and mercy toward it: And this is like the giving the hand to a reviving man, endeavouring to turn himſelf, and to ariſe, to help him up therein, and then,</p>
               <p n="7">7. He more confidently (though yet humbly and penitently) confeſſes his ſins and wretchedneſs to his Father, and humbles himſelf to him, and ſo exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes repentance in theſe acts of it. <hi>Father I have ſinned againſt heaven and before thee, and am not worthy to be called thy Son;</hi> wherein he is like to <hi>Daniel</hi> on his knees and hands, or as one that begins to ſpeak.</p>
               <p n="8">8. And then he receives a full and free pardon of all his former ſins and offences, and is made alive with the life
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:109968:127"/>of juſtification implyed in his calling for, and putting upon him the beſt robe, even the righteouſneſs of his Son, which he will have his Servants and Miniſters alſo to declare to him, or put upon him, being in his Fathers gracious acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, imbracing and kiſſing him, as it were inwardly, and in the Court of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forgiven before: and now he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed alive from the dead, and as a man upon his legs again, while he is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inwardly quickned, but alſo outwardly by his Fathers ſentence proclaimed as an acquit and juſtified perſon, whom he will not call to an account for his former miſpending his living, nor execute judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon him to death, according to the law in that behalf provided againſt rebellious and ſtubborn Children that are gluttonous and drunkards, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.20. but being a new man is owned in Chriſt, in whom he preſents him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf juſt and righteous, and now he hath received him ſafe and ſound, <hi>ver.</hi> 27.</p>
               <p n="9">9. And ſo is further acknowledged as his loving Son, while the ring is put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his finger for ornament, or eſpouſing the ſoul to himſelf again in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:109968:128"/>and faithfulneſs, and his feet ſhod to prepare him to walk up and down as his Son before him; and herein he is fully reſtored to his former ſtate of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with his Father, and Fathers Houſe, and to his priſtine Dignity. And in theſe things.</p>

               <p n="2">2.

Juſt as this Prodigal meeting with a Famine in one place, and pined with hunger, none giving him husks in the other place was that way found, or brought to himſelf to ſay, <hi>How many ſervants in my Fathers houſe have bread enough,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And I will ariſe and go to my Father,</hi> &amp;c. And the way in which God uſually doth this, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. By preſenting and bringing to the ſinners minde in this ſad loſt condition, himſelf in his goodneſs and grace in Chriſt, drawing the ſoul out from its holes and caves, its fields, and bruitiſh ſwiniſh company into the wilderneſs, a ſolitary, mournful, repenting ſtate; and there he is ſaid properly <hi>to finde her,</hi> as it is ſaid, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.5. <hi>I did know thee in the wilderneſs, in the land of great drought,</hi> which is in <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.10. <hi>He found him in a deſert, forſaken land, in the waſte howling Wilderneſs,</hi> &amp;c. And in <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.24. <hi>The wilde Aſſe in the wilderneſs that ſnuffs up the winde at her pleaſure, and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:109968:129" rendition="simple:additions"/>none can turn her away in her occaſion, with whom all that ſeek her will not weary themſelves any longer; yet in her moneth</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>they ſhall finde her:</hi> that is, in the time of trouble, when her pains come upon her, and God is brought to her minde, then ſhe will ſay, Ariſe and ſave us, as <hi>ver.</hi> 27. And indeed when this is hearty and earneſt, as here, then he may be ſaid to be found, and in the next ſtep to it, for he is properly found.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In Gods ſeeing or taking notice of him, in his thinking on, and returning to him; for that's it in which a thing is properly found, when that that could not be eſpyed or ſeen any where before falls ſuddenly into the ſight, and is ſeen and diſcerned. Now his eye is more properly ſet upon the creature when he mindes, regards, and notes it, ſo as to obſerve it by way of gracious reſpect to it: as in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.18. <hi>I have ſeen his wayes, and I will heal him:</hi> and ſo he is ſaid to hear them then too, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19, 20. <hi>I have ſurely heard Ephraim bemoaning himſelf, thou haſt chaſtiſed me, and I was chaſtiſed, as a Bullock unaccuſtomed to the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:109968:130"/>yoke; turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned, for thou art the Lord my God: Surely after I was returned, I repented,</hi> &amp;c. Then God ſees and hears the ſinner when he begins to bemoan himſelf, and repent, and look towards God, and then, <hi>Is Ephraim my dear Son? is he a pleaſant childe; for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I earneſtly remember him ſtill; therefore my bowels are troubled for him: I will ſure have mercy upon him ſaith the Lord.</hi> And then a repenting ſinner being thus found is and may be ſaid to be a perſon found.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the way to God, thinking of him in Chriſt, deſiring after him, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that he may finde help and mercy with him, reſolving to return to him, and putting ſuch reſolutions of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance into practice, humbling himſelf in the belief of his goodneſs, and hope of mercy, as is ſeen: And herein.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the eye, reſpect and gracious obſervance of the Lord, having reſpect to him: as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2. To <hi>that man will I look that is poor, and trembleth at my word.</hi> He <hi>reſpecteth the lowly, but the prond he knows afar off,</hi> Pſal. 138.6. ſuch as think they can live without him.</p>

               <p n="4">4. In the arms of the Lord, who <hi>meets him ſpeedily, falls upon his neck, and kiſſes or embraces him.</hi> Now he is found indeed when he hath him in his arms, in the incloſures of his grace, gracious power, and protection, and promiſes.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In his dear Son. In whom he ſaw and thought upon his Fathers goodneſs, and through whom he received life and motion towards him, reſolutions, and actual performances of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance towards him, and came to him, but now is inſtated into him, and declaredly accepted in him the beloved, <hi>Made in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. Epheſ. 1.6. found in him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. and then he is more fully and formally found when in and through him accepted: So was <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> before an actual, poſitive, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite knowledge of him, and enwrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him about as it were with an expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite diſcovery of him, and giving in the

It faults thoſe that neither indeavor it when they be fallen, nor are glad for it when reſtored, but rather murmur at it, and are offended like the Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees here in this Chapter, were either for ſeeking ſuch that they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, or receiving them when reſtored, ſo far are they from rejoycing at it. If thou thy ſelf that doſt ſo haſt an intereſt
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:109968:143"/>in Chriſt, why ſhouldeſt thou be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at thy brothers reſtauration and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and not rather deſire it, yea, endeavour and rejoyce in it; there's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the leſs room for thee in God's houſe, nor never the leſs chear for thee for the multitude of them that dwell and feed therein. Here the more the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, and never a whit the leſſer chear: for as we have ſhewed the bread of Chriſt's giving is living, growing, and enduring bread; that is no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by being eaten and fed on and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, then the Sun is (perhaps far leſs) by being daily looked upon, or the light of it walked in: And if God pleaſe to ſhew mercy to any great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, why ſhouldeſt thou ſnuff at it, and envy it; <hi>Is thine eye evil, becauſe Gods is good?</hi> Oughteſt thou not rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to ſee a ſoul ſaved from deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that God is ſo gracious to us, who are all of us ſinful enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a thouſand deſtructions at his hands, than to be offended at it? Is it a light matter for a ſoul to go to hell? what pleaſure is that for thee, or what profit in it? ſurely they are more cruel
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:109968:144"/>than Tigers and the moſt ſavage beaſts, that would wiſh their worſt enemies, or the worſt of ſinners ſuch a miſchief, and not rather deſire and endeavour to prevent it, and rejoyce to ſee any good ground to think that God hath prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it upon any; and yet how often is it found, that not only profane and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men take delight in making others ſin, and then make a ſport and jeſt of it, being ſavage Heathens under the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Chriſtians: But even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in Chriſt, and ſeekers of him, are too careleſs of their brethrens ſouls, while they matter not if <hi>for their meat,</hi> or drink, or ſome fooliſh cuſtome, or will, or pleaſure <hi>their brother, for whom Chriſt dyed do periſh,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.25. How far is any unlike therein to Chriſt! who thought it not too much to lay down his precious life to ſave us, and we will ſcarce lay down a toy or trifle, our will or pleaſure, a faſhion or fancy to ſave our brethren, and bring them from miſery to endleſs happineſs? but it is meet when God reclaims by any means, or ſhews mercy to any ſinners, eſpecially to Prodigals and notorious
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:109968:144"/>offenders; yea, though he give them ſome more ſignal teſtimony of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to them upon their returning, then he hath perhaps to our ſelves at any time (which was the thing ſtomacked in the Parable) to make merry and be glad for it; and if ſo, then</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us be exhorted to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour and carriage in ſuch caſes. God is ſometimes affording ſuch inſtances of his great mercy and goodneſs, that we might take notice of him, and give him the glory of it, and ſet forth his praiſes. He ſometimes ſuffers ſuch as profeſs his truth, and have ſome right underſtanding alſo of it, and affection to it to fall into temptations, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by into great ſins and ſufferings, and yet ſhews his mercy on them to their ſalvation, by bringing them into ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for their ſins he ſometimes awakens them (as the Prodigal here) ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to repentance, that they remember, and turn to him, and finde mercy with him; though indeed there be too few ſuch penitents to be found, more there are that imitate this Prodigal in wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring from God, and ſpending his gifts,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:109968:145"/>and their receits in riotous courſes and ſinful converſations, then imitate him in converting &amp; returning unto God again; which is a matter worthy lamentation, &amp; ſurely the ſeverity of God may be ſeen in part therein that he gives up ſo many that wander from him to their hardneſs, and impenitency ſo as to perſiſt to Death and periſh therein. Though God alſo hath a good and gracious end therein to others, for therein he is admoniſhing us to beware of preſumption and preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous ſinning; that ſeeing <hi>he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy,</hi> in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them repentance in ſuch caſes, <hi>and whom he will he hardens</hi> for their preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, we may ſtand in awe, and take heed of abuſing his goodneſs to any in ſuch a way, as to ſay, <hi>Let us do evil that good may come thereof, ſin that grace may more abound. God hath given repentance to ſome that have fallen fowly, and ſhewed them mercy in receiving them again, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will be hold alſo to give way to my corruptions, and take the pleaſures of ſin for a while, I hope God will be merciful al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to me and recover, and receive me again, and I ſhall not periſh therein.</hi> Surely the ſeeing many ſo <hi>turn away, as not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:109968:145"/>but back ſlide by a perpetual back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding, holding faſt deceit and refuſing to return,</hi> as <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.45. might keep us from adventuring on ſo deſperate a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. Thus the Apoſtle teacheth us to improve a like conſideration in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.22, 23. <hi>Be not high minded, but fear, for if God ſpared not the natural Branches,</hi> (that were hardned, blinded, and broken off for their unbelief, <hi>ve.</hi> 7.20.) <hi>take heed leaſt he alſo ſpare not thee.

                  </gap> and fall to their deſtruction. Surely our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who was the Son of God in the moſt proper ſenſe, and the moſt ſure of his love and favour, even in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; yet would not liſten to ſuch a voice of the Tempter, <hi>to caſt himſelf from the pinacle of the Temple,</hi> preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was impoſſible for him to be hurt, becauſe the promiſes belonged to him, of which this was one, that <hi>God would give his Angels charge over him to bear him up in their hands, that he ſhould not at any time daſh his foot againſt a ſtone.</hi> But knowing that God's promiſes are annexed to his ways, and that his keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them was it that ſhould be attended with his being kept in them, he repelled the temptation with having diligent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to God's Commandement bidding man, <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God,</hi> Mat. 6 6, 7. in which he hath ſet us a good example that we might follow his ſteps, and ſure he is a preſumptuous fool
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:109968:146"/>that durſt venture to go where his Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, being wiſer, and ſtronger than he would not venture before him.</p>
               <p>But yet when the goodneſs of God is ſo exerciſed and put forth in his mercy to any as to give repentance, and reſtore them again from their falls and bruiſes (as <hi>God is able to graffe in again</hi> what is broken off, and <hi>raiſe up what is fallen,</hi> even of thoſe that are diſtinguiſhed from, and oppoſed to the <hi>Election that hath obtained,</hi> Rom. 11.7, 14, 23.) let us be glad and rejoyce therein, both for their good in charity to them, and that God is affording ſuch a motive and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to others that have ſinned and are bruiſed thereby, and lye pining away in their ſins to riſe again in repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:109968:147"/>or that he awaken them to repentance by bringing upon them ſome ſignal ſhame and puniſhment to death, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell the Malefactor upon the Croſſe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with Chriſt: And as God is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time pleaſed to ſhew his goodneſs to others brought to like ſhame and death, for the like, or as bad, or worſe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>I know ſome fooliſh or Pharaſaical ones are apt to ſtrange at God's dealings ſometimes in ſuch caſes; as if God could not be ſo gracious to ſuch offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as if it ſtood not with his holineſs, and eſpecially if they be ſoon comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and pretend to great peace and joy in their death having done and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſome hainous offences; as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, Murther, Felony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are apt to ſuſpect they are but deluded perſons, and Satan that inticed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them to commit ſuch ſins, hath again deceived them to make them think God is merciful to them, and forgives and accepts them.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:109968:147"/>their ſins, as <hi>Agag,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Surely the bitterneſs of Death was paſt</hi> with him, when he was g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ing to his execution, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.32. and I wiſh many do not ſo delude themſelves: I am afraid it is ſo. But yet it's not good to either abridge the mercies of God towards, nor the merits of Chriſt for the ſouls of greateſt ſinners, ſo as to deſpair that ſuch may be converted heartily, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived again certainly, and ſometimes ſuddainly, or to judge their repentance and conſolations when there is no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt appearing ground for ſo doing; much leſs when there are appearing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the contrary.</p>
               <p>That God may both convert and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give upon converſion greateſt offenders many things may evince, as the Parable alſo implies: as,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is but ſuitable to God's oath, who hath ſworn <hi>that he hath no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but rather that he turn and live,</hi> Ezek. 33 11. as we noted before, and to his calling the worſt of ſinners, the <hi>ſimple ſcorners</hi> and <hi>fools that hate knowledge,</hi> Prov. 1.22, 23. And thoſe that are compared to the <hi>Princes
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:109968:148"/>of Sodom</hi> and the <hi>people of Gomorrha,</hi> Iſa. 1.10, 15, 16. &amp;c. promſing forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſuch upon their repentance; yea, and <hi>back ſliders</hi> that have come toward him, and gone back again, promiſing to <hi>heal their back ſlidings,</hi> Jer. 3.12, 14, 22. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is ſuitable to the end of Chriſt's coming, who came into the world to ſave ſinners, even chief of ſinners, even ſuch as are <hi>Murtherers of Fathers, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of Mothers, Menkillers, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, Defilers of themſelves with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, Man ſtealers, Lyers, Perjured per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</hi> yea, and thoſe that by the Apoſtle are counted nothing inferior to, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greater than theſe, zealous Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, that ſet up their own righteouſneſs againſt God's in Chriſt, and out of falſe zeal perſecute Chriſt in his truth and members, for upon that account he afterward, after mention of ſuch noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious offenders, ſtiles himſelf <hi>the chief of ſinners,</hi> though a Pharaſee and one of the <hi>ſtricteſt ſect for Religion among the Jews,</hi> and far from thoſe groſs fleſhly abominations, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9, 10, 13, 14 15, 16. indeed nothing but the blood of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:109968:148"/>Chriſt, and the grace of God in him will make ſuch ſinners or any ſinners elſe to be Saints, or cleanſe them from their fins, that will as appears in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 9, 10, 11. where ſuch horrid offenders that had been ſuch are ſaid <hi>to be waſhed, to be juſtified, to be ſanctified</hi> (which what is it but to be made Saints) <hi>in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the ſpirit of God,</hi> no ſorrows, tears, or humiliations of ours can do it without <hi>purging with hyſop</hi> (Pſal. 51.7.) that is, with the blood and by the ſpirit of Chriſt, and that will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Otherwiſe we muſt exclude from heaven thoſe that the Scripture enrols among the Saints, if we think God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not convert and forgive great ſinners, or never doth. What was <hi>David</hi> but a great ſinner, being guilty of acting adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and murther, and yet I hope he was a Saint. Indeed he found many ready to ſay of him, <hi>there was no help for him in God,</hi> when God began to call him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for his ſin, as appears <hi>Pſal.</hi> 3.1, 2. the title whereof is a <hi>Pſalm of David when he fled from Abſolon his Son,</hi> but yet he found it otherwiſe, ſo as to rejoyce
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:109968:149"/>and glory in God, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Thou art my ſhield, my glory, and the lifter up of my head.</hi> Though <hi>Abſolon's</hi> riſing up againſt him was a puniſhment for his ſin, and a remembrance of it, yet God was ſo therein with him having repented (to ſhew the reality of his repentance, and truth of God's acceptance of him) that he was helped to carry that puniſhment of his ſin with much magnanimity. God lifted up his head when many thought (as ſome Pharaſaical Saints are apt yet to think of great ſinners, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if brought to ſhameful ſufferings for their ſins, as he then was) ſurely he muſt be lamentably diſtreſſed and deject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his ſpirit, and hang down his head. He <hi>lay him down and ſlept in the midſt</hi> of his troubles, <hi>for God ſuſtained him;</hi> and he <hi>would not be afraid of ten thouſand of people that had ſet themſelves againſt him round about,</hi> ver. 5.6. See what a ſaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſpirit (yea, even under their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for their ſins) God ſometimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues great ſinners with upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſurely we may not ſay they were deluded, and therefore neither may we conclude that others are ſo, if
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:109968:149"/>having been great and notorious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders they upon turning to God find him comforting them, yea, and filling them with expreſſions of confidence of his favour towards them, and of their ſalvation. For indeed,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt therefore ſuffered like a ſinner and malefactour, that ſinners (yea ſuch ſinners as deſerve and have ſhame and puniſhment here, even the Croſſe or Gallows for their juſt reward) might through him be called and brought to repentance, and dye like Saints, and be Saints in their dying, that is, have hope and joy in him, and in his ſalvation; and this was evidenced in the Croſſe, and at the death of Chriſt. For Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, though the Son of God, and the moſt juſt perſon that ever was in the world, yet he dyed like a Sinner, Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour, Thief, or Murtherer, not onely in that he ſuffered ſuch a death as ſuch offenders uſed to be put to by men (the death of the Croſſe) but alſo in his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as to the manner of it, in reſpect of grief, ſorrow, agonies, that did accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it (yet not without evidences of his righteouſneſs and hope in God his
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:109968:150"/>Father.) For did not he <hi>ſweat</hi> through the violence of his agonies, <hi>as it were great drops of blood trickling down to the ground?</hi> And did he not cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me!</hi> As bearing upon himſelf the puniſhment of ſuch capital offences, though upon our account, not his own; that ſuch as are guilty of ſuch offences, and deſerve ſuch ſorrows, agonies, and rejections of God, might through him have hope and comfort in God in their dyings, though of violent deaths by legal puniſhments, as was ſeen in the Malefactor that ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him dyed like a Saint. We finde no ſuch matter teſtified of him, no agonies nor exclamations as his ſins de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; but on the contrary, rebuking his fellow ſufferer for his reproaching Chriſt, acknowledging the juſtneſs of their ſufferings, and our Saviours inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; and praying Chriſt to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him when he came into his kingdom, he heard this comfortable word (which doubtleſſe ſtrengthened his confidence, and gave him full aſſurance of his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.) <hi>Verily I ſay unto thee, this day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> Surely
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:109968:150"/>this was written for an incouragement, even for ſuch offenders alſo to hope in God by Jeſus Chriſt, and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him for mercy, in an humble acknowledgement of their offences, and of his power to forgive and help them; which that they alſo may obtain of him, (even to the giving them large confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in him, and full aſſurance of their ſalvation.) Chriſt's graciouſneſs to him doubtleſs doth teſtifie, that none may ſay, what ſhould ſuch hainous ſinners dye like Saints? though yet in one ſenſe ſuch dye not as Saints; while they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry not in, nor juſtifie the cauſe of their death; (as thoſe that dye for Chriſt and righteouſneſs ſake may and often do) but in that regard take ſhame to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and acknowledge the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſhame and puniſhment or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to them, as deſerved by them, and ſubmit themſelves thereto. And ſurely it would be too great an injury to the grace of God, and to his love to mankind, and to their welfare: and too great a derogation to the vertues of the precious blood and ſacrifice of the Lord Jeſus, to imagine that ſuch mercy
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:109968:151"/>may not be ſhewed to them, that are ſo great ſinners, both as to make them, in their receit of it, hearty in their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and chearful in their ſpirits under their ſufferings, in the hope of God's ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>Ah! but the ſuddainneſſe of the converſion, and ſpeedineſſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, and the coming ſo eaſily by them, without more drooping and humiliation makes ſome queſtion. They expect ſuch great ſinners ſhould long lye under deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and ſadneſs, before they get a good word from God; and if not ſo, they are apt to conclude them under a deluſion, or but hypocrites in their profeſſion of joy and conſolation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Truly, I would not be miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to ſpeak in behalf of any that are not truly penitent and turned in to Chriſt, or that are daubed with untem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered morter, and ſlightly healed. Yet this is evident, that ſometimes the grace of God makes quicker work in mens converſion, and he more ſpeedily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts them thereupon, than the wiſdom of the fleſh or of man judges fitting, as by this Parable appears, as alſo by the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:109968:151"/>carriage of the Pharaſees toward Chriſt, often cenſuring him for his receiving ſinners while it appears they were not ſatisfied of their converſion. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, had they been firſt made Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, they would not then have been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and judged them ſinners ſtill. The woman that at <hi>Simon</hi>'s houſe ſtood behind Chriſt, and waſhed his feet with her tears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had not ſatisfied the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſee that ſhe was a convert, for then would he not have had indignation thereat, nor ſaid in his heart, <hi>If this man were a Prophet, he would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him, for ſhe is a ſinner,</hi> Luc. 7.39. Surely Chriſt knew her better then he did, and knew her to be a real convert, though it ſeems ſhe had not ſo publickly bewailed her ſelf, and bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſin, as to ſatisfie the Pharaſee that ſhe had left it. And what appears to have been the ſorrow and humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Malectour? we finde nothing ſaid thereof, and yet evident tokens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear of his real converſion, and he had ſpeedy abſolution: For,</p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:109968:152"/>
               <p n="1">1. He rebuked his fellow for his carriage towards Chriſt, as if he had been turned a ſuddain Preacher of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to him, <hi>Feareſt thou not God ſeeing we are in the ſame condemnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He confeſſed his ſins, and juſtified the righteouſneſs of his death, ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf upon that account to bear it patiently. <hi>And we indeed juſtly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. He confeſſed Chriſt, and juſtified him in his ſufferings, and that when the whole multitude, the Princes, Prieſts, and zealous Pharaſees, and learned Rabbies, the <hi>chief builders</hi> did moſt of all reject him, deſpiſe, and deride him. And when he was in his deepeſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. <hi>But this man hath done nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. He in this loweſt caſe of Chriſt, when his own Diſciples durſt not own him, owns and profeſſes his faith in him, that he was Lord and King; and that he ſhould have the kingdom, and ſo that God would glorifie him through and after thoſe his ſufferings, ſaying, <hi>Lord remember me when thou comeſt into thy kingdom.</hi> And</p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:109968:152"/>
               <p n="5">5. In that faith he calls upon him as upon the Saviour of the world, or of ſinners, ſaying, <hi>Lord remember me,</hi> &amp;c. as intimately profeſſing his faith, that he could forgive, and ſave, and bleſſe him.</p>
               <p>We finde no great lamentation for his ſin, nor dejection under the ſenſe of it, but yet a better confeſſion of faith we ſcarce finde from any of the Apoſtles, who were now ſhrunk from him. Yea, <hi>Peter</hi> that thought to have ſtood it out, denied him. See here how ſuddainly and ſilently the grace of God may work a notable alteration as to converſion, and then ſee the ſpeedineſs of Chriſt in forgiving and comforting. He lets him not hang long drooping to his death upon the Croſſe, but preſently tells him, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> And was it not ſo with <hi>David,</hi> he <hi>ſaid he would confeſs his ſin, and God forgave the puniſhment of it.</hi> He ſaid but, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> and <hi>Nathan</hi> replies, <hi>the Lord alſo hath taken away thy ſin, thou ſhalt not dye,</hi> Pſal. 32.5. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. So <hi>Peter</hi> had but begun to ſpeak to the Gentiles, and preſently the
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:109968:153"/>Holy Ghoſt fell on them, and they ſpake with tongues, without any long hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them firſt for the ſins of their Gentiliſm, or bringing them into the profeſſion of Judaiſm by circumciſion, as it ſeems the Diſciples of the Jews had ſome thought he ſhould have done, by their quarrelling with <hi>Peter</hi> for his eating with and receiving them, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. Yea, and <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf ſays, <hi>what was I that I could withſtand God!</hi> as if there might be ſome ſuch leaven in him alſo as to have kept them longer out from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and made them more humbled firſt before he would have received them had they been at his diſpoſing. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſuſpect its our hypocriſies, or want of thoroughneſs in coming off from our idols, our <hi>ſticking long in the place of the breaking forth of children,</hi> that <hi>increaſes</hi> and <hi>lengthens</hi> our <hi>throws</hi> and <hi>ſorrows.</hi> Hoſ. 13.13. As while <hi>David kept cloſe his ſin his bones waxed old, and he roared out with daily diſquiets,</hi> Pſal. 32.1, 2. the heart that comes off ſoon and roundly from its ſin is ſooner comforted. So the compaſſionte Father here, ſo ſoon as he ſees his Sons reſolution, and finds him
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:109968:153"/>upon his way to him; yea, <hi>While he was yet a great way off</hi> preſently <hi>runs to meet him,</hi> and <hi>falls upon his neck and kiſſes him.</hi> Oh haſty Father, and too paſſionately fond, thinks his Pharaſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Son to ſhew ſo much love before no more humbling. He was not yet fallen on his knees ſcarce, and behold his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther falls upon his neck. He had not yet confeſſed his ſins, only ſays he would, and the Father prevents him with his compaſſion, and before he could utter all he had to ſay, calls for the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted calf, and the beſt robe to feed and cloth him, and therefore he hears of it afterward, <hi>As ſoon as this thy Son was come, that hath devoured all thy ſubſtance with harlots, thou haſt killed for him the fatted calf.</hi> And ſo how apt are we to ſay, Oh! they muſt be ſoundly humbled before we may ſhew them any hopes of mercy towards them; and yet indeed its hope of mercy here that humbled him, yea, the beſt and ſweeteſt humbling is after the receit of mercy. Then <hi>Mary loved much,</hi> and wept much when <hi>much was forgiven,</hi> Luc. 7.47. and ſo in <hi>Ezeck.</hi> 16.60, 61, 62, 63. when <hi>God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:109968:154"/>his Covenant</hi> with adulterous and idolatrous <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>makes an everlaſting Covenant</hi> with them, then ſhe <hi>ſhall remember her ways and be aſhamed,</hi> &amp;c. yet if God ſpeedily comfort men we are ready to ſay, it was ſome deluſion, they were not humbled enough.</p>
               <p>But what is that that men call hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled enough? I fear as ſome are not humbled and aſhamed for their ſins, ſo ſome may miſtake and idolize it. If by being humbled enough they mean, ſo as to give ſatisfaction for their ſins, or make an amends for them, that's an enough that none can attain to, and therefore Chriſt <hi>humbled himſelf to death, the death of the Croſſe for us,</hi> Philip. 2.7. and was not he humbled enough for us think we? it is upon the account of his humiliation, and not of ours, that God receives ſatisfaction, and forgives us, None can be ſufficiently humbled for the leaſt abuſe of any mercy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the forgiveneſs of it thereupon, but in Chriſt: God is the beſt eſtimator of our being humbled, ſo as to be fitted to receive what Chriſt's humiliation and ſufferings for us have purchaſed; and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:109968:154"/>he ſeems to men ſometimes to accept of a ſmall meaſure or time of humbling, as the inſtances before recited make manifeſt. And if God ſpeak peace to any upon ſhort and ſlight humbling to appearance (yea, or when he ſees us go <hi>on frowardly, turning aſide in the way of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

When God comforts any, how can they be dejected! would we have them play the hypocrites to humour us, counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit terrour and dejection when God ſpeaks peace to them? ſurely no.</p>
               <p>Again, we vain creatures are apt to judge of mens being humbled by the outſide, the ſad countenance, plenty of tears, ſorrowful tones, wringing of hands <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but God ſees the heart. And <hi>God that knows the heart bare them witneſs</hi> (ſays <hi>Peter</hi>) ſpeaking of the Gentiles, ſo ſuddainly in their uncircumciſion recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in by him. And indeed we may find the Scriptures mention perſons as well humbled, and ſo as God counts them
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:109968:155"/>meet to be comforted: When,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They having ſinned do (or are willing to) ingenuouſly confeſſe, and not hide, cloke, extenuate, or plead for their ſin and filthineſſe, and turn from them.

This God himſelf makes the character of an humble heart in his ſight, when in the view of him <hi>the uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed heart is humbled, and they accept of the puniſhment of their iniquity, confeſsing that they have walked contrary to God, and he hath walked contrary to them,</hi> Lev. 26.40, 41, 42. and that was the great
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:109968:156"/>act of Chriſt's humbling himſelf for us, that he accepted the puniſhment of our iniquity, and yielded up himſelf to bear it quietly, not repining or grudging thereat. And here alſo in this Parable the Prodigals humiliation appears in this chiefly; that riſing and coming to his Father he confeſſes his ſin, ſubmits himſelf to bear the ſhame of having his Father or Servants ſee his poor eſtate, and to be in any place how mean ſoever that his Father would put him in, though of <hi>an hired ſervant,</hi> ſo he might but be received. And ſurely, when we finde any that have been great ſinners turned in from their evil ways, confeſſing their ſin and vileneſſe, and ſubmitting to the grace of Chriſt to ſeek their abſolution, reſt and righteouſneſſe there, ſubmitting themſelves to walk in his ways, and bear his chaſtiſements; and if in ſo doing (yea though there be ſome imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their ſo doings) they meet with refreſhings and rejoycings in God and Chriſt, and in the riches of his grace, we may rejoyce in their behalf, as here the family are called upon by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Let us make merry and be glad.</hi>

He is a chearful ſpirit, and leads to chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and loves not ſullen ſowre frames and diſpoſitions. Yet we poor fooliſh creatures (as I prove ſometimes my ſelf) are apt to be either carnally, lightly, wantonly and vainly merry, or elſe on the other extream, to eſpouſe to our ſelves a ſad, glumpiſh ſpirit, a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, rugged, harſh diſpoſition, or Pharaſaical face. For they <hi>put on ſowre ſad countenances,</hi> as too many yet do as a piece of religion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.16. as if God delighted in ſuch Cynick or Stoick frames, formal bodily humilities, a whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning voice, a <hi>head hanging down like a bul-ruſh,</hi> and ſuch like ſelf-tormenting carriages. No, no, God is a chearful Spirit, as having infinite joy and delight in himſelf, and in his Son, and in his works and doings, and He and his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit call for, and lead to chearfulneſs in his ſervice.

If he frown upon us we have no cauſe to make merry, but to mourn before him till he call us to mirth, and further then he calls us to mirth and to make merry, we ſhall do well to be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and attend to him. But when he calls us to joy and gladneſſe, as here, and to make merry, we may in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of his grace do ſomething; as to ſay, we may, and let us,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hearken to the voice of God and his ſervants calling us thereto, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening the cauſe thereof, and the grounds for it to us. Such as be his mercy towards ſinners, and to us and our Brethren in what he hath done for, and to both us and them. As the Servants ſay here to the elder Son, inquiring the cauſe of their mirth. <hi>Thy Brother is come, and thy Father hath killed the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Calfe.</hi> And the Father here: <hi>It was meet we ſhould make merry and be glad, for this thy Brother was dead, and is alive again; was loſt, and is found.</hi> And indeed upon theſe two grounds eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is the cauſe of mirth and joy; Gods goodneſſe, and our Brethrens welfare and happineſſe, as alſo our own through

Nor ſo taken up as in the Parable, <hi>Luc.</hi> 14.18. about our Oxen, Farmes, and Wives, as to think thereby to excuſe our ſelves from coming in to this feaſt. No, nor ſo ſuperciliouſly proud with this Pharaſaical elder Brother in his fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſtemper, to think the grace of God is too free, and too freely expoſed and propoſed to ſinners, and they too
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:109968:161"/>eaſily admitted into Chriſt's and his peoples fellowſhip, and ſo into God's houſe, and to feaſt therein. As if it were only fit for us, and ſuch holy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as we conceit our ſelves to be, that are ſo regulated, and have lived ſo obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently: as if we feared the lameneſſe, blindneſſe, maimedneſſe, that is, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, ignorances, and defects of the other gueſts and in-goers would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect us; or their looſer demeanours formerly, their riotous livings and being publicans and ſinners, would too much diſgrace us if we ſhould go and fit in God's houſe with them ſuch viſe wretches. This was the fault of this elder Son here; he was a Schiſmatick as he was in this temper, he would rent from his Fathers houſe. Why, I pray you? oh my Brother (nay, I will not own him for a Brother) that ſpend-thrift, that hath devoured his living with harlots is intertained there, and he is too bad for me to joyn with. Thruſt him out, and I will come in galdly. Let me, and ſuch as I am have the calf to our ſelves, and we ſhall need but little intreating. He is offended at his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:109968:161"/>badneſſe, though not at preſent continued in. He hath repented it and hath left it. Indeed it is implyed that there is no ground of joying in or for ſinners elſe, nor are any faulty for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to joyn with them, if they have not teſtified repentance. But the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have teſtified of him. <hi>Thy Father hath received him ſafe and ſound.</hi> Now yet to hang back is too incredulouſly done.

This is too much unbelief, not to believe the Servants, te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, unleſſe we have aſſurance from God of our Brethrens converſion. This, <hi>ſtand by thy ſelf, come not near me, for I am holier than thou,</hi> is it that oftentimes makes men Schiſmaticks from God's houſe, Saints and Servants, but theſe are ſo far from pleaſing God better than others, that he ſaith of them, <hi>Theſe are a ſmoke in my noſtrils, a fire that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth all the day long,</hi> Iſa. 65.5.

But here we muſt take heed that we take on with us the Wedding Garment (for this is a Wedding feaſt too) which is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red alſo by the feaſt-maker for us as well as the feaſt, that is, that in our coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of Chriſt to joyn with Chriſt, and his people or worſhippers, we <hi>put the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſo as to come only upon the account of him, and the grace of God in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not preſuming upon our own worthineſſe to approach
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:109968:162"/>his table, or lay claim to his proviſion, though alſo putting on his vertues in our believing in and on him. <hi>Putting off the deeds of darkneſſe, put on the armour of light, not walking in ſurfettings and drunkenneſſe, chamberings and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſtrife and envyings; but put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, making no proviſion for the fleſh to fullfil it in the luſts thereof,</hi> Rom. 13.12, 13, 14. that is, <hi>put on as the Elect of God</hi> in receiving the grace of God, as thoſe that are <hi>holy &amp; beloved</hi> the vertues of Chriſt, <hi>Bowels of mercy, meekneſſe, kindneſſe, humbleneſſe of mind,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Coll.</hi> 3.13. Otherwiſe if we take up only the form of godlineſſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the power; the profeſſion, and deny ſubjection to Chriſt and his Spirit, we ſhall be caſt out again into outer dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.13, but ſo coming and being entred, <hi>Let us eat and be merry.</hi> Unleſs we eat our meat, and drink our drink, that our heavenly Father hath provided for us, we ſhall never be merry. Faſting and mirth are not meet concomitants, but feaſting and mirth. Our Father hath killed for us the fatted calf; indeed he bid his Servants do it, and ſo they do
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:109968:163"/>in a ſort, in their miniſterial holding forth Chriſt crucified for us. Yea, all are his ſervants, they that crucified Chriſt did but therein <hi>what his hand and counſel had determined to be done,</hi> Act. 4.28. But the Son puts it upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Thou haſt killed for him the fatted calf.</hi> God hath prepared him for us, <hi>delivered him up for our ſins, and raiſed him again for our juſtification.</hi> Sets him forth in the Goſpel as a ſacrifice offered up for our ſins, and gives him to us as the bread of life to eye and believe in, exerciſe faith in, and ſo feed upon him. We are not put upon it, or called upon in this feaſt to bring any diſh with us, but only to eat what he hath prepared and made ready for us. It will make our Father's heart glad to ſee us accept his love, and eat heartily of his meat, and eat together like brethren lovingly. He will not think his fatted calf ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on us, if we will but eat hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on it. Yea, therein he hath delighted, its meat and drink to him his Sons obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and righteouſneſſe, and in and through him, its as meat and drink to him to ſee us eat heartily on him too.
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:109968:163"/>Do not look upon our meat only (though its good to look on it too; for its ſo lovely, and altogether pleaſing to an enlightned eye, that it will allure us to eat) but alſo eat of it, feed on it, put it in our mouths, let it go down into our bellies or hearts. <hi>Cauſe our bellies to eat, and fill our bowels with it,</hi> Ezek. 3.3. <hi>If thou confeſſe with thy mouth Jeſus the Lord, and in thine heart believe that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Rom. 10.10. But what have we no drink to our meat? yes, yes, I warrant you, our Father keeps a good bountiful houſe, he hath a cup of good wine for us, <hi>ſpiced wine,</hi> the moſt choiſe wine, the <hi>blood of the grape,</hi> and yet its but the fatted calf ſtill; <hi>For his fleſh is meat indeed,</hi> his being incarnate and made fleſh for us, his being delivered up to death for our ranſome and redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He, as therein the way for us to God, the mediator of God and us, the receptacle for us and convayer of the grace and bleſſing of God to us: This is our meat, and <hi>its meat indeed. And his blood is drink indeed,</hi> his abaſement and ſufferings as obtaining for us and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:109968:164"/>to us the New Teſtament, and its precious promiſes which are all in him (by vertue of this his moſt preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous blood obtaining for us the continual pardon of our ſins) yea, and Amen. Affirmed and confirmed, or ratified for and to us. This, this, and the love here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in teſtified is drink indeed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.55. <hi>His love is better than wine, will cauſe the lips of thoſe that are aſleep to ſpeak,</hi> Cant. 2.2. and 7.9. come then, let us eat together of this meat, this is better than to feed on <hi>the fleſh of our own arms,</hi> Iſa. 9.20. That's pittiful ſtuff; that is, what we can do and gather up to and for our ſelves by our own ſtrength, our faſtings, prayers, whinings, pinings, works of righteouſneſſe of our own doings, our humblings and ſelf abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as reflected on by us. The fleſh and blood of this fatted calf is ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times better; it will make us ſtrong to labour and work what is good, and make us thankful to him that gives it to us, and to acknowledge our ſelves infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely unworthy ſuch a diſh to have been prepared for us; but theſe things are the fruits and effects of it fed on,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:109968:164"/>not the meat we are to eat, much leſſe what is but the iſſue of our own power and ſtrength. Come then Brethren, let us ſit at it here, and eat and drink hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily if we will be merry and glad, and make our Father merry and glad, and our Brethren merry and glad. <hi>Let's eat, and drink, and be merry here.</hi> This will never make us Epicures, <hi>nor drunkards, nor riotous eaters of fleſh. Here is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe</hi> in this feaſt, eat and drink of it what we can. <hi>Eat we that that is good, and let our ſouls delight themſelves in fatneſſe.</hi> Hereto we are invited and called upon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2, 3. And here call we upon one another too, as our Lord doth upon us all. <hi>Eat, oh friends, yea, drink, yea drink abundantly of my love</hi> (as ſome tranſlate that) <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1. Our Father will never chide us or tax us for it, as gluttonous eaters of fleſh or drunkards. I ſay, for eating our fills here, nor ſhall we need to ſpare this fatted calf is a liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſh, that will grow upon us in the eating it; the more we eat the more we may eat, and the more we eat of it the more welcome. And the wine here will do like the oil in the miracle, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:109968:165"/>as we empty it, or drink of it. Here's a Princely feaſt, no law to limit us how much to eat or drink. Oh! that all the Epicures, drunkards and gluttons in the world would lay aſide their epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiſm, in which they ſpend and waſt God's creatures, and break his laws, and bring upon themſelves miſery and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and turn gluttons and drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards here if they can. Yea, here its law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and a priviledge to be drunken, for ſo ſome read that in <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Drink, and be ye drunken, oh! my beloved,</hi> or <hi>with my love.</hi> And to be ſure if Chriſt make men drunk, he will never fault them for it; if men drink here till they looſe their own underſtanding, reaſon, ſenſes, it will never harm them; for they looſe them not for the worſe, as in bodily and ſinful drunkenneſſe, to be made like beaſts; but for the better, to be made like Angels, or conformable to Chriſt. To be drunk into his Spirit, his will, mind, judgment, and to be carried above not beneath our ſelves. Here we may call for cups and flagons too, <hi>Stay me with flagons,</hi> Cant. 2.5. <hi>be not drunk with wine then, wherein is exceſſe,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:109968:165"/>but be filled with the ſpirit</hi> of love, and of Chriſt, there's no exceſſe in that, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.18, 19. This wine will exhila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or chear us, while it aſſures us of God's love in Chriſt, and aſcertains us of the injoyment of his promiſes, yea, and convays them to us. This wine will indeed make glad our hearts. <hi>Let's eat, drink and be merry</hi> then here (not <hi>for to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow we ſhall dye,</hi> but) and we ſhall never dye. We ſhall never drink our ſelves dead here, as the drunkards of this world do, but we ſhall drink our ſelves alive, we ſhall drink death away, and drink our ſelves into eternal life. For <hi>whoſo eateth my fleſh,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>and drinketh my blood hath eternal life,</hi> Joh, 6.56. And this will beget mirth, and as it begets mirth, let us make it or be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up to it: For it makes us</p>

But how ſhall we come by it? why, drink but off our cups of the wine forementioned, and we ſhall have <hi>Pſalms</hi> ſpring up in us, as the ſpirit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of alſo hath compoſed ſome by his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the Prophets for us, and take we of them. <hi>Be we filled with the Spirit</hi> (in eating this meat and drinking, this drink foreſpoke of the love of God in Chriſt) <hi>ſpeaking to our ſelves</hi> (as implying that then we ſhall ſpeak, for it <hi>will make the lips of them that are aſleep to ſpeak,</hi> as was noted before in <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.9. but not as drunkards often do in a ſinful way, but) <hi>Pſalms, and Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, ſinging and making melody in our hearts to the Lord,</hi> that is, to the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, commending, and glorifying him, <hi>Epheſ,</hi> 5.18.19. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16.
